  abstract = {BackgroundPatients received care over telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their perspective is useful for hand surgeons.MethodsOnline surveys were sent October-November 2020 to 497 patients who received telemedicine care. Questions were free-response and multi-item Likert scales asking about telehealth in general, limitations, benefits, comparisons to in-person visits, and opinions on future use.ResultsThe response rate was 26\% (n = 130). Prior to the pandemic, 55\% had not used telemedicine for hand surgery consultation. Patients liked their telemedicine visit and felt their provider spent enough time with them (means = 9/10). In all, 48\% would have preferred in-person visits despite the pandemic, and 69\% would prefer in-person visits once the pandemic concludes. While 43\% had no concerns with telemedicine, 36\% had difficulties explaining their symptoms. Telemedicine was easy to access and navigate (M = 9/10). However, 23\% saw telemedicine of limited value due to the need for an in-person visit soon afterward. Of these patients, 46\% needed an in-person visit due to inadequate physical examination. Factors that make telemedicine more favorable to patients included convenience, lack of travel, scheduling ease, and time saved. Factors making telemedicine less favorable included need for in-person examination or procedure, pain assessment, and poor connectivity. There was no specific appointment time the cohort preferred. Patient recommendations to improve telemedicine included decreasing wait times and showing patient queue, wait time, or physician status online.ConclusionsTelemedicine was strongly liked by patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, nearly 70\% of patients still preferred in-person visits for the future.},

Methods Nine individual interviews were conducted with chronic back pain patients after admission to an orthopaedic hospital ward. Data were analysed using content analysis. Results The patients' experiences of healthcare encounters can be described by the theme ``Struggling to be seen and understood as a person,'' comprising the categories ``Lack of access and trust to care,'' ``A desire to be taken care of and listened to'' and ``Own strength to handle healthcare situations.''},

  abstract = {Background Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) causing neurogenic claudication is a leading cause of pain, disability and loss of independence in older adults. The prevalence of lumbar spinal stenosis is growing rapidly due to an aging population. The dominant limitation in LSS is walking ability. Postural, physical and psychosocial factors can impact symptoms and functional ability. LSS is the most common reason for spine surgery in older adults yet the vast majority of people with LSS receive non-surgical treatment. What constitutes effective non-surgical treatment is unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-modal and self-management training program, known as the Boot Camp Program for LSS aimed at improving walking ability and other relevant patient-centred outcomes. Methods We will use a pragmatic two-arm randomized controlled single blinded (assessor) study design. Eligible and consenting participants will be randomized to receive from licensed chiropractors either a 6-week (twice weekly) self-management training program (manual therapy, education, home exercises) with an instructional workbook and video and a pedometer or a single instructional session with an instructional workbook and video and pedometer. The main outcome measure will be the self-paced walking test measured at 6 months. We will also assess outcomes at 8 weeks and 3 and 12 months. Discussion Symptoms and functional limitations in LSS are variable and influenced by changes in spinal alignment. Physical and psychological factors result in chronic disability for patients with LSS. The Boot Camp Program is a 6-week self-management training program aimed at the multi-faceted aspects of LSS and trains individuals to use self-management strategies. The goal is to provide life-long self-management strategies that maximize walking and overall functional abilities and quality of life. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02592642 .},

Methods In this retrospective study, 2 researchers independently extracted data from the medical records from January 2010 to April 2013 of consecutive eligible patients who had completed the 6-week Boot Camp Program. The program consisted of manual therapy twice per week (eg, soft tissue and neural mobilization, chiropractic spinal manipulation, lumbar flexion-distraction, and muscle stretching), structured home-based exercises, and instruction of self-management strategies. A paired t test was used to compare differences in outcomes from baseline to 6-week follow-up. Outcomes included self-reported pain, disability, walking ability, and treatment satisfaction. Results A total of 49 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 70 years. The mean difference in the Oswestry Disability Index was 15.2 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 11.39-18.92), and that for the functional and symptoms scales of the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire was 0.41 (95\% CI, 0.26-0.56) and 0.74 (95\% CI, 0.55-0.93), respectively. Numeric pain scores for both leg and back showed statistically significant improvements. Improvements in all outcomes were clinically important. Conclusions This study showed preliminary evidence for improved outcomes in patients with neurogenic claudication participating in a 6-week nonsurgical multimodal Boot Camp Program.},

This study focuses on patients reporting CMP, assessing 1-year clinical outcomes after a multimodal digital care program (DCP) versus non-participants, who enrolled in the program but never engaged in a single exercise session or partook of the educational content made available to them. In this longitudinal study ad-hoc analysis, pain and functionality outcomes at 1-year reassessment were studied, focusing on the odds of reaching minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and, overall average reduction in both outcomes. Healthcare utilization was additionally studied within the same period. From 867 individuals allocated to the study, 460 completed the 1-year reassessment (intervention group: 310; comparison group: 150). The intervention group presented sustained and greater pain reduction until 1-year reassessment than the comparison group, reflecting greater odds ratio of achieving the MCID both in pain and functionality (1.90 95\% CI: 1.27--2.86, p = 0.002 and 2.02 95\% CI: 1.31--3.12, p = 0.001, respectively). A lower healthcare utilization during the 1-year follow-up was observed in the intervention group than in the comparison group. This study suggests that a digital CMP program may have a lasting impact on improved pain and functionality in patients with CMP.},

  abstract = {Digital interventions have emerged as a solution for time and geographical barriers, however, their potential to target other social determinants of health is largely unexplored. In this post-hoc analysis, we report the impact of social deprivation on engagement and clinical outcomes after a completely remote multimodal musculoskeletal (MSK) digital care program managed by a culturally-sensitive clinical team. Patients were stratified in five categories according to their social deprivation index, and cross-referenced with their race/ethnicity, rurality and distance to healthcare facilities. From a total of 12,062 patients from all U.S. states, 8569 completed the program. Higher social deprivation was associated with greater baseline disease burden. We observed that all categories reported pain improvements (ranging from -2.0 95\%CI -2.1, -1.9 to -2.1 95\%CI -2.3, -1.9, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) without intergroup differences in mean changes or responder rates (from 59.9\% (420/701) to 66.6\% (780/1172), p\,=\,0.067), alongside reduction in analgesic consumption. We observed significant improvements in mental health and productivity across all categories, with productivity and non-work-related functional recovery being greater within the most deprived group. Engagement was high but varied slightly across categories. Together these findings highlight the importance of a patient-centered digital care program as a tool to address health inequities in musculoskeletal pain management. The idea of investigating social deprivation within a digital program provides a foundation for future work in this field to identify areas of improvement.},

While the software has been an essential tool for productivity, learning, and social interaction, something about being on videoconference all day seems particularly exhausting, and the term ``Zoom Fatigue'' caught on quickly. In this article, I focus on nonverbal overload as a potential cause for fatigue, and provide four arguments outlining how various aspects of the current Zoom interface likely lead to psychological consequences. The arguments are based on academic theory and research, but also have yet to be directly tested in the context of Zoom, and require future experimentation to confirm. Instead of indicting the medium, my goal is to point out these design flaws to isolate research areas for social scientists and to suggest design improvements for technologists.},

Conservative therapies are universally recommended but require patient engagement and self-management to be effective. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a 12-week digital care program (DCP) in a large population of patients with chronic knee and back pain. Methods: A longitudinal observational study was conducted using a remote DCP available through a mobile app. Subjects participated in a 12-week multimodal DCP incorporating education, sensor-guided exercise therapy (ET), and behavioral health support with 1-on-1 remote health coaching. The primary outcome was pain measured by the visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary measures included engagement levels, program completion, program satisfaction, condition-specific pain measures, depression, anxiety, and work productivity. Results: A total of 10,264 adults with either knee (n=3796) or low back (n=6468) pain for at least three months were included in the study. Participants experienced a 68.45\% average improvement in VAS pain between baseline intake and 12 weeks. In all, 73.04\% (7497/10,264) participants completed the DCP into the final month. In total, 78.60\% (5893/7497) of program completers (7144/10,264, 69.60\% of all participants) achieved minimally important change in pain. Furthermore, the number of ET sessions and coaching interactions were both positively associated with improvement in pain, suggesting that the amount of engagement influenced outcomes. Secondary outcomes included a 57.9\% and 58.3\% decrease in depression and anxiety scores, respectively, and 61.5\% improvement in work productivity. Finally, 3 distinct clusters of pain response trajectories were identified, which could be predicted with a mean 76\% accuracy using baseline measures. Conclusions: These results support the efficacy and scalability of a DCP for chronic low back and knee pain in a large, diverse, real-world population. Participants demonstrated high completion and engagement rates and a significant positive relationship between engagement and pain reduction was identified, a finding that has not been previously demonstrated in a DCP. Furthermore, the large sample size allowed for the identification of distinct pain response subgroups, which may prove beneficial in predicting recovery and tailoring future interventions. This is the first longitudinal digital health study to analyze pain outcomes in a sample of this magnitude, and it supports the prospect for DCPs to serve the overwhelming number of musculoskeletal pain sufferers worldwide.

  abstract = {Background: Several systematic reviews (SRs) assessing the use of telemedicine for musculoskeletal conditions have been published in recent years. However, the landscape of evidence on multiple clinical outcomes remains unclear. Objective: We aimed to summarize the available evidence from SRs on telemedicine for musculoskeletal disorders. Methods: We conducted an umbrella review of SRs with and without meta-analysis by searching PubMed and EMBASE up to July 25, 2022, for SRs of randomized controlled trials assessing telemedicine. We collected any kind of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), patient-reported experience measures (PREMs), and objective measures, including direct and indirect costs. We assessed the methodological quality with the AMSTAR 2 tool (A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2). Findings were reported qualitatively. Results: Overall, 35 SRs published between 2015 and 2022 were included. Most reviews (n=24, 69\%) were rated as critically low quality by AMSTAR 2. The majority of reviews assessed ``telerehabilitation'' (n=29) in patients with osteoarthritis (n=13) using PROMs (n=142 outcomes mapped with n=60 meta-analyses). A substantive body of evidence from meta-analyses found telemedicine to be beneficial or equal in terms of PROMs compared to conventional care (n=57 meta-analyses). Meta-analyses showed no differences between groups in PREMs (n=4), while objectives measures (ie, ``physical function'') were mainly in favor of telemedicine or showed no difference (9/13). All SRs showed notably lower costs for telemedicine compared to in-person visits. Conclusions: Telemedicine can provide more accessible health care with noninferior results for various clinical outcomes in comparison with conventional care. The assessment of telemedicine is largely represented by PROMs, with some gaps for PREMs, objective measures, and costs. Trial Registration: PROSPERO CRD42022347366; https://osf.io/pxedm/},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Given the rapid advances in communication technology and the need that emerged from the COVID19 pandemic, telehealth initiatives have been widely used worldwide. This masterclass aims to provide an overview of telerehabilitation for musculoskeletal conditions, synthesizing the different terminologies used to describe telehealth and telerehabilitation, its effectiveness and how to use it in clinical practice, barriers and facilitators for the implementation in health services, and discuss the need of a curriculum education for the near future. Main body:{\enspace} Telerehabilitation refers to the use of information and communication technologies provided by any healthcare professionals for rehabilitation services. Telerehabilitation is a safe and effective option in the management of musculoskeletal conditions in different models of delivery. There are many technologies, with different costs and benefits, synchronous and asynchronous, that can be used for telerehabilitation: telephone, email, mobile health, messaging, web-based systems and videoconferences applications. To ensure a better practice of telerehabilitation, the clinician should certify safety and access, and appropriateness of environment, communication, technology, assessment, and therapeutic prescription. Despite the positive effect of telerehabilitation in musculoskeletal disorders, a suboptimal telerehabilitation implementation may have happened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in countries where telehealth was not a reality, and clinicians lacked training and guidance. This emphasizes the need to identify the necessary curriculum content to guide future clinicians in their skills and knowledge for telerehabilitation. There are some challenges and barriers that must be carefully accounted for to contribute to a health service that is inclusive and relevant to health professionals and end users. Conclusions:{\enspace} Telerehabilitation can promote patient engagement in health care and plays an important role in improving health outcomes in patients with musculoskeletal conditions. Digital health technologies can also offer new opportunities to educate patients and facilitate the process of behavior change to a healthy lifestyle. Currently, the main needs in telerehabilitation are the inclusion of it in health curriculums in higher education and the development of cost-effectiveness and implementation trials, especially in low- and middle-income countries where access, investments and digital health literacy are limited.},

The sample included both those who had, and had not, previously engaged in telerehabilitation programmes.ProceduresAn online questionnaire collected demographic information and data regarding previous telerehabilitation participation and telerehabilitation preferences. Focus groups were conducted using videoconferencing software, in accordance with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) Checklist, and analysed using thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke's methodology. Findings were triangulated with quantitative questionnaire data.ResultsFour focus groups were conducted including participants with chronic cardiorespiratory (n\,=\,8), neurological (n\,=\,6) and musculoskeletal (n\,=\,4) conditions. Three themes were identified regarding telerehabilitation: (a) benefits and facilitators (including convenience, increased service accessibility, social connection and technological support), (b) challenges and barriers (including technological access and literacy, limited `hands-on' therapy, safety concerns and social limitations), and (c) preferences (regarding mode of delivery, content, duration and generic programmes for mixed-condition groups).ConclusionsTelerehabilitation is convenient for people with chronic conditions; however, concerns exist regarding the use of technology and the limitations of this healthcare delivery method. The role of telerehabilitation is valued, and future programmes should acknowledge patient preferences including a hybrid model of care, exercise and educational content, social interaction and synchronous components.},

  abstract = {Background Musculoskeletal physiotherapy practice rapidly adopted telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate the experiences and attitudes of people who would not usually engage with these services. Methods A sequential mixed-methods study recruited people with musculoskeletal pain conditions accessing Australian private practice physiotherapist services. Part 1 involved an online survey of telehealth services accessed, treatments and resources provided, self-reported global change in condition, and attitudes toward telehealth. Part 2 involved semi-structured interviews with a subset of survey participants, exploring experiences and attitudes towards telehealth. Quantitative data was reported descriptively. Qualitative data was evaluated using inductive thematic analysis. Results 172 participants responded to the survey, and 19 were interviewed. 95\% accessed video-based telehealth, and 85\% reported condition improvement. 84\% agreed it was an efficient use of their time, 75\% agreed it was financially viable, and 73\% agreed their condition was accurately diagnosed. 62\% percent believed telehealth should be less expensive than in-person services. Qualitative analysis revealed four themes (17 subthemes), including (i) telehealth had value, but generally perceived as inferior to in-person care; (ii) challenges related to assessment, diagnosis, `hands on' treatment, observation, communication, and technology; (iii) advantages to access safe, expert, and convenient care; and (iv) importance of supportive technology, including video and supplementary resources. Conclusion Physiotherapist telehealth services provided to people with musculoskeletal pain during the pandemic was valued. However, telehealth was generally perceived as inferior to traditional in-person care, and may be best used as part of a hybrid model of care.},

The experiments include diverse content audio-visual material, e.g., Sports, TV Commercials, Interviews, Music, Documentaries and Cartoons, impaired with several visual (bitrate compression, packet-loss, and frame-freezing) and auditory (background noise, echo, clip, chop) distortions. Each experiment explores a particular domain. In Experiment 1, the video component was degraded with visual artifacts, meanwhile, the audio component did not suffer any type of degradation. In Experiment 2, the audio component was degraded while the video component remained untouched. Finally, in Experiment 3 both audio and video components were degraded. As expected, results confirmed a dominance of the visual component in the overall audio-visual quality. However, a detailed analysis showed that, for certain types of audio distortions, the audio component played a more important role in the construction of the overall perceived quality.},

  abstract = {Objective. Investigate physical therapists' perceptions of, and willingness to use, telephone- and internet-mediated service models for exercise therapy for people with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. Methods. An internet-based survey of Australian physical therapists comprising three sections: i) demographic information; and 16 positively-framed perception statements about delivering exercise via ii) telephone and; iii) video over the internet, for people with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. Levels of agreement with each statement were evaluated. Logistic regression models were used to determine therapist characteristics influencing interest in delivering telerehabilitation. Results. 217 therapists spanning metropolitan, regional, rural and remote Australia completed the survey. For telephone-delivered care, there was consensus agreement it would not violate patient privacy (81\% agreed/strongly agreed) and would save patient's time (76\%), however there was less than majority agreement for 10 statements. There was consensus agreement video-delivered care would save a patient's time (82\%), be convenient for patients (80\%), and not violate patient privacy (75\%). Most agreed with all other perception statements about video-delivered care, except for liking no physical contact (14\%). Low confidence using internet video technologies, and inexperience with telerehabilitation, were significantly associated with reduced interest in delivering telephone and/or video-based services. Conclusion. Physical therapists agree telerehabilitation offers time-saving and privacy advantages for people with osteoarthritis, and perceive video-delivered care more favorably than telephone-delivered services. However, most do not like the lack of physical contact with either service model. These findings may inform the implementation of telerehabilitation osteoarthritis services, and the training needs of clinicians involved in delivering care. This article is protected by copyright.

DESIGN:Eligible patients with a musculoskeletal condition presenting to a physical therapist in private practice were randomized to the following: (a) control (home exercise prescribed by therapist's usual methods) or (b) intervention (home exercise prescribed using a web-based exercise programming system). The primary outcome was self-rated exercise adherence measured at week 3 via 11-point Numeric Rating Scales. Secondary outcomes were satisfaction with exercise delivery and confidence in ability to undertake prescribed exercise. Process measures were also included. RESULTS:We enrolled 305 participants, with loss to follow-up of 14.5\% (22/152) and 13.7\% (21/153) in intervention and control groups, respectively. Compared with controls, the intervention group reported higher exercise adherence (mean difference Numeric Rating Scale units (95\% confidence intervals): adherence overall -1.0 [-1.6 to -0.3] and regarding number of exercises in session -0.7 [-1.3 to -0.1], number of repetitions -0.8 [-1.4 to -0.2], and number of sessions -1.0 [-1.6 to -0.3]). The intervention group showed greater confidence to exercise than control, with no difference in satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS:A web-based exercise programming system improved home exercise adherence and confidence in ability to undertake exercise, although the clinical relevance of the results needs to be established.},

  abstract = {Background This systematic review aimed to assess the certainty of evidence for digital versus conventional, face-to-face physiotherapy assessment of musculoskeletal disorders, concerning validity, reliability, feasibility, patient satisfaction, physiotherapist satisfaction, adverse events, clinical management, and cost-effectiveness. Methods Eligibility criteria: Original studies comparing digital physiotherapy assessment with face-to-face physiotherapy assessment of musculoskeletal disorders. Systematic database searches were performed in May 2021, and updated in May 2022, in Medline, Cochrane Library, Cinahl, AMED, and PEDro. Risk of bias and applicability of the included studies were appraised using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool and the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies tool. Included studies were synthesised narratively. Certainty of evidence was evaluated for each assessment component using GRADE. Results Ten repeated-measures studies were included, involving 193 participants aged 23--62 years. Reported validity of digital physiotherapy assessment ranged from moderate/acceptable to almost perfect/excellent for clinical tests, range of motion, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), pain, neck posture, and management decisions. Reported validity for assessing spinal posture varied and was for clinical observations unacceptably low. Reported validity and reliability for digital diagnosis ranged from moderate to almost perfect for exact+similar agreement, but was considerably lower when constrained to exact agreement. Reported reliability was excellent for digital assessment of clinical tests, range of motion, pain, neck posture, and PROMs. Certainty of evidence varied from very low to high, with PROMs and pain assessment obtaining the highest certainty. Patients were satisfied with their digital assessment, but did not perceive it as good as face-to-face assessment. Discussion Evidence ranging from very low to high certainty suggests that validity and reliability of digital physiotherapy assessments are acceptable to excellent for several assessment components. Digital physiotherapy assessment may be a viable alternative to face-to-face assessment for patients who are likely to benefit from the accessibility and convenience of remote access. Trial registration The review was registered in the PROSPERO database, CRD42021277624.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of remote rehabilitation interventions for people living with chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression. DESIGN: A systematic review with network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials. LITERATURE SEARCH: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, and PsycINFO databases from inception to May 2023. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of remote rehabilitation interventions in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression. DATA SYNTHESIS: We used Bayesian random-effects models for the NMA. Effect estimates were comparisons between rehabilitation interventions and waitlist. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on bias in the randomization process, large trials ({$>$}100 patients per arm) and musculoskeletal condition. RESULTS: Fifty-eight randomized controlled trials involving 10 278 participants (median sample size: 137; interquartile range [IQR]: 77--236) were included. Interactive voice response cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.66, 95\% credible interval [CrI] -1.17 to -0.16), CBT in person (SMD -0.50, 95\% CrI -0.97 to -0.04), and mobile app CBT plus exercise (SMD -0.37, 95\% CrI -0.69 to -0.02) were superior to waitlist at 12-week follow-up for reducing pain ({$>$} 98\% probability of superiority). For depression outcomes, Internet-delivered CBT and telecare were superior to waitlist at 12-week follow-up (SMD -0.51, 95\% CrI -0.87 to -0.13) ({$>$} 99\% probability of superiority). For pain outcomes, the certainty of evidence ranged from low to moderate. For depression outcomes, the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The proportion of dropouts attributed to adverse events was unclear. No intervention was associated with higher odds of dropout. CONCLUSION: Interactive voice response CBT and mobile app CBT plus exercise showed similar treatment effects with in-person CBT on pain reduction among people living with chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression had over 98\% probability of superiority than waitlist control at 12-week follow-up. Internet-delivered CBT and telecare had over 99\% probability of superiority than waitlist control for improving depression outcomes at 12-week follow-up.

  abstract = {Objective The purpose of this scoping review was to identify information about telehealth and rehabilitation for the evaluation and management of musculoskeletal disorders, patient satisfaction, cost, and access as may be applicable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We searched MEDLINE for studies published between January 1, 2000, and June 1, 2019. Search terms consisted of MEDLINE medical subject headings and other words relevant to this review, including ``telerehabilitation,'' ``musculoskeletal,'' ``telemedicine,'' ``therapy,'' ``chiropractic,'' ``ergonomics,'' and ``exercise.'' This review targeted studies of people aged 18 years and older with musculoskeletal concerns. Articles on diagnostic tests, effectiveness of treatment, patient satisfaction, access to care, and cost were included. Results Eleven studies were included in this review. Interrater reliability and agreement were moderate to high for several assessment procedures for the lower limb, elbow, and low back. Two clinical trials demonstrated that provider and patient simultaneous telehealth were equally as effective as in-office care. Patient and provider satisfaction with telehealth were reported to be equal to or higher than for conventional rehabilitation. We found no studies reporting cost or access. Conclusion In the COVID-19 pandemic environment, telehealth is feasible for health care providers to provide rehabilitation services for their patients with various musculoskeletal conditions. Current evidence suggests that for some musculoskeletal disorders, telehealth evaluation may be reliable, treatment may be effective, and patient satisfaction may be good or better than for in-office care. Results from this study may help physiatry, physical therapy, and chiropractic health care providers in their decisions to implement telehealth during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:  Electronic health resources are helpful only when people are able to use them, yet there remain few tools available to assess consumers' capacity for engaging in eHealth. Over 40\% of US and Canadian adults have low basic literacy levels, suggesting that eHealth resources are likely to be inaccessible to large segments of the population. Using information technology for health requires eHealth literacy---the ability to read, use computers, search for information, understand health information, and put it into context. The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) was designed (1) to assess consumers' perceived skills at using information technology for health and (2) to aid in determining the fit between eHealth programs and consumers. OBJECTIVES:  The eHEALS is an 8-item measure of eHealth literacy developed to measure consumers' combined knowledge, comfort, and perceived skills at finding, evaluating, and applying electronic health information to health problems. The objective of the study was to psychometrically evaluate the properties of the eHEALS within a population context. A youth population was chosen as the focus for the initial development primarily because they have high levels of eHealth use and familiarity with information technology tools. METHODS:  Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 3- and 6-month follow-up using control group data as part of a single session, randomized intervention trial evaluating Web-based eHealth programs. Scale reliability was tested using item analysis for internal consistency (coefficient alpha) and test-retest reliability estimates. Principal components factor analysis was used to determine the theoretical fit of the measures with the data. RESULTS:  A total of 664 participants (370 boys; 294 girls) aged 13 to 21 (mean = 14.95; SD = 1.24) completed the eHEALS at four time points over 6 months. Item analysis was performed on the 8-item scale at baseline, producing a tight fitting scale with {$\alpha$} = .88. Item-scale correlations ranged from r = .51 to .76. Test-retest reliability showed modest stability over time from baseline to 6-month follow-up (r = .68 to .40). Principal components analysis produced a single factor solution (56\% of variance). Factor loadings ranged from .60 to .84 among the 8 items. CONCLUSIONS:  The eHEALS reliably and consistently captures the eHealth literacy concept in repeated administrations, showing promise as tool for assessing consumer comfort and skill in using information technology for health. Within a clinical environment, the eHEALS has the potential to serve as a means of identifying those who may or may not benefit from referrals to an eHealth intervention or resource. Further research needs to examine the applicability of the eHEALS to other populations and settings while exploring the relationship between eHealth literacy and health care outcomes.

This white paper leverages NSR's Non-GEO Constellations Analysis Toolkit 2.0 (NCAT2) to factually dive into the capabilities and limitations of LEO constellations, and the LEO-GEO4 complementation potential. Using SpaceX as example, and assuming two Starlink5 sub-constellations fully deployed, the paper follows a multipleperspective approach to analysis: It includes a granular supply and demand assessment, interference-avoidance exclusion angles, ARPU and distribution considerations. The paper concludes with perspectives on how, in the future, LEOs may best interplay with well-established GEOs. Today's fast-paced environment brings unprecedented opportunities for the telecommunications industry as a whole to make the most out of disruptive innovations and investments in space networks, both Non-GEO and GEO. However, orbital dynamics of LEO satellites drive the need to assess impacts differently, as not all LEO satellite capacity is either usable or uniformly distributed across the coverage regions.},

Of concern is whether telemedicine access was poorer among higher-needs and disadvantaged populations.To assess patient characteristics associated with telemedicine use and telemedicine mode and describe telemedicine visit experiences by telemedicine mode.This cross-sectional study included data from the 2022 Health Information National Trends Survey and included US adults with a health care visit. Data were analyzed from May to September 2023.Patient characteristics.Any telemedicine visits vs in-person visits only; telemedicine mode (video vs audio-only). Multivariable logistic models assessed patient characteristics associated with telemedicine visits and mode. Bivariate analyses compared telemedicine experiences by mode.The study included 5437 adult patients (mean [SE] age, 49.4 [0.23] years; 3136 females [53.4\%]; 1928 males [46.6\%]). In 2022, 2384 patients (43\%) had a telemedicine visit; 1565 (70\%) had a video visit while 819 (30\%) had an audio-only visit. In multivariable models, older age ({$\geq$}75 years: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.42-0.94), no internet use (aOR, 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.48-0.81), and living in the Midwest (aOR, 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.70) were negatively associated with having telemedicine visits. Female sex (aOR, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.12-1.83), having chronic conditions (aOR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 1.66-2.73), and multiple health care visits (2-4 visits: aOR, 1.77; 95\% CI, 1.23-2.54; {$\geq$}5 visits: aOR, 3.29; 95\% CI, 2.20-4.92) were positively associated. Among individuals who used telemedicine, older age (65-74 years: aOR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 1.09-4.14; {$\geq$}75 years: aOR, 3.58; 95\% CI, 1.60-8.00), no health insurance (aOR, 2.84; 95\% CI, 1.42-5.67), and no internet use (aOR, 2.11; 95\% CI, 1.18-3.78) were positively associated with having audio-only visits. We observed no significant differences in telemedicine use or mode by education, race and ethnicity, or income. Patients' experiences using telemedicine were generally similar for video and audio-only except more individuals who used audio-only had privacy concerns (20\% vs 12\%, P\,=\,.02).In this cross-sectional study of adults with health care visits, many patients, including those with the greatest care needs, chose telemedicine even after in-person visits were available. These findings support continuing this care delivery approach as an option valued by patients. Differences were not observed by most common measures of socioeconomic status. Continued monitoring of telemedicine use is needed to ensure equitable access to health care innovations.},

  abstract = {null Policy Points Telehealth has many potential advantages during an infectious disease outbreak such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to telehealth as a prominent care delivery mode.Not all health care providers and patients are equally ready to take part in the telehealth revolution, which raises concerns for health equity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.Without proactive efforts to address both patient- and provider-related digital barriers associated with socioeconomic status, the wide-scale implementation of telehealth amid COVID-19 may reinforce disparities in health access in already marginalized and underserved communities.To ensure greater telehealth equity, policy changes should address barriers faced overwhelmingly by marginalized patient populations and those who serve them. Context The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed fundamental shifts across the US health care delivery system, including a rapid transition to telehealth. Telehealth has many potential advantages, including maintaining critical access to care while keeping both patients and providers safe from unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus. However, not all health care providers and patients are equally ready to take part in this digital revolution, which raises concerns for health equity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study analyzed data about small primary care practices' telehealth use and barriers to telehealth use collected from rapid-response surveys administered by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Bureau of Equitable Health Systems and New York University from mid-April through mid-June 2020 as part of the city's efforts to understand how primary care practices were responding to the COVID-19 pandemic following New York State's stay-at-home order on March 22. We focused on small primary care practices because they represent 40\% of primary care providers and are disproportionately located in low-income, minority or immigrant areas that were more severely impacted by COVID-19. To examine whether telehealth use and barriers differed based on the socioeconomic characteristics of the communities served by these practices, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to stratify respondents as being in high-SVI or low-SVI areas. We then characterized respondents' telehealth use and barriers to adoption by using means and proportions with 95\% confidence intervals. In addition to a primary analysis using pooled data across the five waves of the survey, we performed sensitivity analyses using data from respondents who only took one survey, first wave only, and the last two waves only. Findings While all providers rapidly shifted to telehealth, there were differences based on community characteristics in both the primary mode of telehealth used and the types of barriers experienced by providers. Providers in high-SVI areas were almost twice as likely as providers in low-SVI areas to use telephones as their primary telehealth modality (41.7\% vs 23.8\%; P {$<$}.001). The opposite was true for video, which was used as the primary telehealth modality by 18.7\% of providers in high-SVI areas and 33.7\% of providers in low-SVI areas (P {$<$}0.001). Providers in high-SVI areas also faced more patient-related barriers and fewer provider-related barriers than those in low-SVI areas. Conclusions Between April and June 2020, telehealth became a prominent mode of primary care delivery in New York City. However, the transition to telehealth did not unfold in the same manner across communities. To ensure greater telehealth equity, policy changes should address barriers faced overwhelmingly by marginalized patient populations and those who serve them.},

  abstract = {Innovation is a form of realising a new way of doing something, often ignoring traditional wisdom, in order to meet new challenges. Globally, particularly in emerging economies, the high burden of musculoskeletal conditions and their contribution to multimorbidity continue to rise, as does the gap for services to deliver essential care. There is a growing need to find solutions to this challenge and deliver person-centred and integrated care, wherein empowering patients with the capacity for self-management is critical. Whilst there is an abundance of information available online to support consumer education, the number of sources for credible medical information is diluted by uninformed anecdotal social media solutions. Even with the provision of high-quality information, behavioural change does not necessarily follow, and more robust educational approaches are required. In this chapter, we examine innovation, its management and the strategic directions required to improve musculoskeletal healthcare at macro (policy), meso (service delivery) and micro (clinical practice) levels. We discuss the critical role of consumer agency (patients and their families/carers) in driving innovation and the need to leverage this through empowerment by education. We provide a snapshot of real-world examples of innovative practices including capacity building in consumer and interprofessional musculoskeletal education and practice; recommendations to transform the access and delivery of integrated, person-centred care; and initiatives in musculoskeletal care and implementation of models of care, enabled by digital health solutions including telehealth, remote monitoring, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and big data. We provide emerging evidence for how innovation can support systems' strengthening and build capacity to support improved access to 'right' musculoskeletal care, and explore some of the ways to best manage innovations. We conclude with recommended systematic steps to establish required leadership, collaboration, research, networking, dissemination, implementation and evaluation of future innovations in musculoskeletal health and care.},

  abstract = {Purpose To assess telehealth adoption among hospitals located in rural and urban areas, and identify barriers related to enhanced telehealth capabilities in the areas of patient engagement and health information exchange (HIE) capacity with external providers and community partners. Methods We used the 2018 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey and IT Supplement Survey. We applied state fixed effects multivariate analyses and Oaxaca decomposition to estimate the variation of outcomes of interest by hospital geographies. Findings Our research showed substantial differences in telehealth adoption among hospitals located in rural, micropolitan, and metropolitan areas, where adoption rates increase with urbanicity. Rural hospitals were least likely to have telehealth systems with patient engagement capabilities such as the ability to view their health information online and electronically transmit medical information to a third party. They were also the least likely to report that clinical information was available electronically from outside providers. Our model explained 65\% of the rural/urban difference in telehealth adoption, 55\% of the number of telehealth services adopted, and 43\%-49\% of the rural/urban difference in telehealth barriers. Conclusion Findings demonstrated significant barriers to telehealth use among hospitals located in rural and urban areas. For rural hospitals, barriers include lack of HIE capacity among health care providers in the community, and lack of patient engagement capability.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To estimate the economic benefit of evidence-based patient-initiated virtual physical therapy (PIVPT) service among a nationally representative sample of commercially insured patients with musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions. Study Design: Counterfactual simulation. Methods: Using a nationally representative sample from the 2018 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we simulated the direct medical care savings and indirect cost savings from reduced absenteeism resulting from PIVPT among commercially insured working adults with self-reported MSK conditions. Model parameters of the impact of PIVPT are drawn from peer-reviewed literature. Four potential benefits of PIVPT are explored: (1) more rapid access to PT, (2) improved adherence to PT, (3) less expensive PT care per episode, and (4) reduced/avoided referral costs of PT. Results: The mean medical care savings per person per year from PIVPT range between \$1116 and \$1523. Savings are mainly attributed to early initiation of PT (35\%) and lower cost of PT (33\%). The benefits of PIVPT result in a mean reduction of 6.6 hours in pain-related missed work per person per year. The return on investment of PIVPT is 2.0 (medical savings only) or 2.2 (medical savings plus reduced absenteeism). Conclusions: PIVPT service provides added value to MSK care by facilitating earlier access and better adherence to PT and lowering the cost of PT.},

COVID-19 related healthcare closures resulted in a rapid backlog of patients referred to a provincial interprofessional LBP program. Without management, these patients were at high risk of experiencing untoward outcomes. Virtual care became a logical option. However, many clinicians lacked experience and confidence with LBP virtual care (LBP-VC); and either were unfamiliar with, or did not have access to, requisite technology. Multi-stakeholder engagement was utilized to understand barriers, identify enablers, and ultimately promote VC for LBP. As a result of the multi-stakeholder engagement, the concept of a toolkit for LBP-VC, including clinical resources and guidelines, emerged. The toolkit contains preparatory steps for VC and a standardized approach to virtual LBP assessment. Key steps in the toolkit have potential applicability to other musculoskeletal populations.},

Methods{\enspace} On September 17--18, 2021, SPINE20 held its annual meeting in Rome, Italy. Prior to the meeting, the SPINE20 created six proposed recommendations. These recommendations were uploaded to the SPINE20 website 10 days before the meeting and opened to the public for comments. The recommendations were discussed at the meeting allowing the participants to object and provide comments. Results{\enspace} In total, 27 societies endorsed the following recommendations. SPINE20 calls upon the G20 countries: (1) to expand telehealth for the access to spine care, especially in light of the current situation with COVID-19. (2) To adopt value-based interprofessional spine care as an approach to improve patient outcomes and reduce disability. (3) To facilitate access and invest in the development of a competent rehabilitation workforce to reduce the burden of disability related to spine disorders. (4) To adopt a strategy to promote daily physical activity and exercises among the elderly population to maintain an active and independent life with a healthy spine, particularly after COVID-19 pandemic. (5) To engage in capacity building with emerging countries and underserved communities for the benefit of spine patients. (6) To promote strategies to transfer evidence-based advances into patient benefit through effective implementation processes. Conclusions{\enspace} SPINE20's initiatives will make governments and decision makers aware of efforts to reduce needless suffering from disabling spine pain through education that can be instituted across the globe.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment delivered via real-time telerehabilitation for the management of musculoskeletal conditions, and to determine if real-time telerehabilitation is comparable to conventional methods of delivery within this population. DATA SOURCES:Six databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, PEDro, psycINFO, CINAHL) were searched from inception to November 2015 for literature which reported on the outcomes of real-time telerehabilitation for musculoskeletal conditions. REVIEW METHODS:Two reviewers screened 5913 abstracts where 13 studies (n = 1520) met the eligibility criteria. Methodological quality was assessed using the Downs \& Black 'Checklist for Measuring Quality' tool. Results were pooled for meta-analysis based upon primary outcome measures and reported as standardised mean differences and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS:Aggregate results suggest that telerehabilitation is effective in the improvement of physical function (SMD 1.63, 95\%CI 0.92-2.33, I(2)=93\%), whilst being slightly more favourable (SMD 0.44, 95\%CI 0.19-0.69, I(2)=58\%) than the control cohort following intervention. Sub-group analyses reveals that telerehabilitation in addition to usual care is more favourable (SMD 0.64, 95\%CI 0.43-0.85, I(2)=10\%) than usual care alone, whilst treatment delivered solely via telerehabilitation is equivalent to face-to-face intervention (SMD MD 0.14, 95\% CI -0.10-0.37, I(2) = 0\%) for the improvement of physical function. The improvement of pain was also seen to be comparable between cohorts (SMD 0.66, 95\%CI -0.27-1.60, I(2)=96\%) following intervention. CONCLUSIONS:Real-time telerehabilitation appears to be effective and comparable to conventional methods of healthcare delivery for the improvement of physical function and pain in a variety of musculoskeletal conditions.},

  abstract = {Introduction Telehealth's potential to improve access to specialty health care, increase favorable patient outcomes, and save money demands attention. Unfortunately, patients often fail to embrace telehealth. The COVID-19 pandemic fueled greater telehealth usage globally. Little is known about patient perceptions of telehealth in the context of a pandemic. Therefore, we sought to understand patient perceptions of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore relevant policy implications. Design Researchers used a cross-sectional, non-experimental design to survey 366 patients across two telehealth programs at a Mississippi academic health sciences center between November 1, 2021 and November 15, 2021. Methods As part of a larger, psychometric study on patient acceptance of telehealth, participants rated the item, ``The COVID-19 pandemic has made me more open to using telehealth'' on a 5-point Likert scale (1~=~strongly disagree; 5~=~strongly agree). Means of the different groups were analyzed using independent t-test and one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc multiple comparisons. Results Of the total participants, 73\% (n~=~366) either agreed or strongly agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic had made them more open to using telehealth. Significant differences existed by age (p~=~0.016), race/ethnicity (p~=~0.015), and sex (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), however, groups did not differ by age during post-hoc analysis. A significant difference in the mean responses was observed between black participants (M~=~4.29) and white participants (M~=~3.91; p~=~0.011). In addition, female participants (M~=~4.11) rated the item higher than male participants (M~=~3.65). Conclusion As access to telehealth increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, patients' perceptions to telehealth seem to have shifted in the positive direction as well. Findings may be used to support expansion of telehealth and advocacy for patients in a variety of settings. Clinical Relevance Study findings indicate that participants of telehealth are more open to using telehealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing telehealth should be a priority to increase access to care for those who have limited access to specialty care, and policymakers should advocate to decrease barriers to telehealth within their institutions.},

Digital exercise-based interventions have shown great potential in the management of musculoskeletal conditions, promoting access and easing the economic burden. However, evidence of their effectiveness for chronic LBP (CLBP) management compared to in-person physiotherapy has yet to be unequivocally established. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with CLBP following a digital intervention versus evidence-based in-person physiotherapy. Our results demonstrate that patient satisfaction and adherence were high and similar between groups, although a significantly lower dropout rate is observed in the digital group (11/70, 15.7\% versus 24/70, 34.3\% in the conventional group; P\,=\,0.019). Both groups experience significant improvements in disability (primary outcome), with no differences between groups in change from baseline (median difference: -0.55, 95\% CI: -2.42 to 5.81, P\,=\,0.412) or program-end scores (-1.05, 95\% CI: -4.14 to 6.37; P\,=\,0.671). Likewise, no significant differences between groups are found for secondary outcomes (namely pain, anxiety, depression, and overall productivity impairment). This RCT demonstrates that a remote digital intervention for CLBP can promote the same levels of recovery as evidence-based in-person physiotherapy, being a potential avenue to ease the burden of CLBP.},

Participants An international Delphi panel comprising a Steering Group and experts in the field, including physiotherapy researchers, physiotherapy clinicians, representatives of physiotherapy organisations, and consumers. Methods The draft framework was developed by the research team and Steering Group, based on relevant documents identified within the literature. The panel considered a draft framework of 73 specific capabilities mapped across eight domains. Over three rounds, panellists rated their agreement (Likert or numerical rating scales) on whether each capability was essential (core) for physiotherapists to deliver quality care via videoconferencing. Those capabilities achieving consensus, defined as 75\% of the panel ratings being {$\geq$} 7 out of 10 in Round 3, were retained. Results A total of 130 panellists from 32 countries participated in Round 1, with retention rates of 65\% and 60\% in Rounds 2 and 3, respectively. The final framework comprised 60 capabilities across seven domains: compliance (n~= 7 capabilities); patient privacy and confidentiality (n~= 4); patient safety (n~= 7); technology skills (n~= 7); telehealth delivery (n~= 16); assessment and diagnosis (n~= 7); and care planning and management (n~= 12). Conclusion This framework outlines the specific core capabilities required of physiotherapists to provide quality care via videoconferencing. The core capability framework provides guidance for physiotherapists to deliver care via videoconferencing and will help inform future development of physiotherapy curricula and professional development initiatives in the delivery of telehealth.},

  abstract = {Background: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a significant problem affecting millions of people worldwide. Three widely implemented psychological techniques used for CLBP management are cognitive therapy (CT), mindfulness meditation (MM), and behavioral activation (BA). This study aimed to evaluate the relative immediate (pre- to post-treatment) and longer term (pre-treatment to 3- and 6-month follow-ups) effects of group, videoconference-delivered CT, BA, and MM for CLBP.; Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a three-arm, randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of three active treatments-CT, BA, and MM-with no inert control condition. Participants were N\,=\,302 adults with CLBP, who were randomized to condition. The primary outcome was pain interference, and other secondary outcomes were also examined. The primary study end-point was post-treatment. Intent-to-treat analyses were undertaken for each time point, with the means of the changes in outcomes compared among the three groups using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Effect sizes and confidence intervals are also reported.; Results: Medium-to-large effect size reductions in pain interference were found within BA, CT, and MM (ds from\,-\,.71 to\,-\,1.00), with gains maintained at both follow-up time points. Effect sizes were generally small to medium for secondary outcomes for all three conditions (ds from\,-\,.20 to\,-\,.71). No significant between-group differences in means or changes in outcomes were found at any time point, except for change in sleep disturbance from pre- to post-treatment, improving more in BA than MM (d\,=\,\,-\,.49).; Conclusions: The findings from this trial, one of the largest telehealth trials of psychological treatments to date, critically determined that group, videoconference-delivered CT, BA, and MM are effective for CLBP and can be implemented in clinical practice to improve treatment access. The pattern of results demonstrated similar improvements across treatments and outcome domains, with effect sizes consistent with those observed in prior research testing in-person delivered and multi-modal psychological pain treatments. Thus, internet treatment delivery represents a tool to scale up access to evidence-based chronic pain treatments and to overcome widespread disparities in healthcare.; Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03687762.

  abstract = {Background Remote consultations (RCs) enable clinicians to continue to support patients when face-to-face appointments are not possible. Restrictions to face-to-face care during the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a pre-existing trend for their adoption. This is true for many health professionals including some chiropractors. Whilst most chiropractors in the UK have used RCs in some form during the pandemic, others have not. This study seeks to understand the views of chiropractors not using RCs and to explore perceived potential barriers. Methods A national online survey was completed by 534 registered practicing UK chiropractors on the use of RCs. Respondents had the opportunity of providing open-ended responses concerning lack of engagement in RCs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Textual responses obtained from 137 respondents were coded and analysed using thematic analysis. Results The use of RCs provided an opportunity for chiropractors to deliver ongoing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many chiropractors expressed concern that RCs misaligned with their strong professional identity of providing `hands-on' care. Some chiropractors also perceived that patients expected physical interventions during chiropractic care and thus considered a lack of demand when direct contact is not possible. In the absence of a physical examination, some chiropractors had concerns about potential misdiagnosis, and perceived lack of diagnostic information with which to guide treatment. Clinic closures and change in working environment led to practical difficulties of providing remote care for a few chiropractors. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic may have accelerated changes in the way healthcare is provided with RCs becoming more commonplace in primary healthcare provision. This paper highlights perceived barriers which may lead to reduced utilisation of RCs by chiropractors, some of which appear fundamental to their perceived identity, whilst others are likely amenable to change with training and experience.},

As a result, with the growing popularity of the gaming industry, video game live streaming is expected to induce a new and yet unprecedented surge in the digital landscape, especially with the development of online platforms, such as Twitch.TV, YouTube gaming and Facebook Gaming etc., allowing a real-time content dissemination and consumption. Therefore, with the proliferation of video game live streaming and the increasing number of gamers and professional players worldwide, this paper examines viewer engagement in live video-game streaming platforms. Although few researchers have addressed the subject, our aim is to outline users' motivations, as highlighted in the literature, as well as forms of engagement in these services through a case study of Twitch.TV and YouTube Gaming platforms. Moreover, as discussed in communication and social computing literature, we address the importance of chat messages through IRC in fostering simultaneous interaction with the streamer and other peers.},

  abstract = {Background: The Patient Education Empowerment Programme (PEEP) is an interdisciplinary group intervention for people living with chronic pain. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown and restrictions on in-person group-based health care delivery in South Africa, PEEP was modified to a telehealth electronic format (ePEEP) and offered to patients on a waiting list at two interdisciplinary chronic pain clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility and acceptability of ePEEP through the perspectives of individuals with chronic pain who participated in ePEEP.~ METHODS: A qualitative, exploratory descriptive study was conducted. One month after completion of the 6-week ePEEP programme, individuals who participated, were recruited for the study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Data analysis followed an iterative process of inductive content analysis.~ RESULTS: Six individuals, all women, consented and participated in the study. Three main themes emerged from the data. Theme one focussed on how ePEEP initiated a journey of personal development and discovery within the participants. In theme two, participants reflected on the importance and value of building peer and therapeutic relationships as part of ePEEP. In theme 3, participants shared that the online learning environment had~features which influenced learning about pain in different ways.; Conclusion: ePEEP was found to be acceptable, feasible and valuable for the participants. ePEEP facilitated self-discovery, empowerment, relationship building and transformation in the participants, through experiential learning. Although barriers and facilitators to learning were present, both enhanced the learning experience. The positive reception of this telehealth initiative indicates potential for enhanced access to chronic pain management services in the South African setting. ({\copyright} 2022. The Author(s).)},

  abstract = {Telehealth is a promising approach to support self-management with the potential to overcome geographical barriers. Understanding patient perspectives will identify practical challenges to delivering self-management strategies by telehealth. The aim of this study was to synthesize the perceptions of people with chronic musculoskeletal pain for engaging in interventions delivered using telehealth. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and PsycINFO databases. We included qualitative studies that explored perceptions or experiences or attitudes of people with chronic musculoskeletal pain engaging with telehealth. We assessed the methodological quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Meta-synthesis was guided by a thematic synthesis approach. The level of confidence of review findings was assessed using the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Studies (GRADE-CERQual). Twenty-one studies were included (n = 429). Telehealth comprised web-based, videoconference-based, telephone-based, video-based, and smartphone app--based programs delivered solely or combined. Chronic musculoskeletal conditions included people with knee or hip osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain, persistent pain (chronic joint pain or nonspecific chronic musculoskeletal pain), rheumatoid arthritis, and functional fatigue syndrome. The enablers for engaging in telehealth interventions were as follows: (1) ``at my own pace, space, and place'' and (2) empowered patient. Barriers to engaging in telehealth interventions were as follows: (1) impersonal, (2) technological challenges, (3) irrelevant content, and (4) limited digital (health) literacy. Telehealth interventions with well-designed interactive platforms, flexibility to fit patients' routine, and the broad availability of material may favor better engagement. Encouragement of self-efficacy is linked to successful telehealth-delivered self-management programs.},

  abstract = {Background Practice-based guidelines recommend patient education and exercise as first-line care for low back pain (LBP); however, these recommendations are not routinely delivered in practice. GLA:D{\textregistered} Back, developed in Denmark to assist clinicians to implement guideline recommendations, offers a structured education and supervised exercise program for people with LBP in addition to a clinical registry to evaluate patient outcomes. In this study we evaluated the feasibility of implementing the GLA:D{\textregistered} Back program in Australia. We considered clinician and patient recruitment and retention, program fidelity, exploring clinicians' and patients' experiences with the program, and participant outcome data collection. Methods Clinicians (chiropractors and physiotherapists) were recruited and participated in a 2-day GLA:D{\textregistered} Back training course. Patients were eligible to participate if they had persistent or recurrent LBP. Feasibility domains included the ability to: (1) recruit clinicians to undergo training; (2) recruit and retain patients in the program; (3) observe program fidelity; and (4) perceive barriers and facilitators for GLA:D{\textregistered} Back implementation. We also collected data related to: (5) clinician confidence, attitudes, and behaviour; and (6) patient self-reported outcomes related to pain, disability, and performance tests. Results Twenty clinicians (8 chiropractors, 12 physiotherapists) participated in the training, with 55\% (11/20) offering GLA:D{\textregistered} Back to their patients. Fifty-seven patients were enrolled in the program, with 67\% (38/57) attending the final follow-up assessment. Loss to follow up was mainly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed program fidelity, with clinicians generally delivering the program as intended. Interviews revealed two clinician themes related to: (i) intervention acceptability; and (ii) barriers and facilitators to implementation. Patient interviews revealed themes related to: (i) intervention acceptability; and (ii) program efficacy. At 3 months follow-up, clinicians demonstrated high treatment confidence and biomedical orientation. Patient outcomes trended towards improvement. Conclusion GLA:D{\textregistered} Back implementation in Australia appears feasible based on clinician recruitment, program acceptability and potential benefits for patient outcomes from the small sample of participating clinicians and patients. However, COVID-19 impacted patient recruitment, retention, and data collection. To scale-up GLA:D{\textregistered} Back in private and public settings, further work is warranted to address associated barriers, and to leverage facilitators.},

Too often we create harms from unnecessary labels and subsequent treatments that waste healthcare resources. Learning from Preventing Overdiagnosis conferences, Choosing Wisely1, the BMJ's Too Much Medicine2 and JAMA's Less is More3 campaigns, we opine that sport and exercise medicine is not exempt from overlabelling. For clinicians and researchers, a single label captures a textbook chapter's worth of information. It helps characterise and organise peoples' conditions within definable boundaries. Just as a patient wants to find a cause for their woes, we clinicians pride ourselves on identifying it. If a label can legitimise an individual's experience, provide identity, and enable external support through access to services and insurance, what's not to love? Why don't we clinicians quickly and indelibly punch the label into a patient's electronic medical record? There is a dark side to the face of the diagnostic label. A label implies that the clinician knows the specific tissue pathology that is causing pain or dysfunction. In sport and exercise medicine, accurate tissue or pathoanatomical (`structural') diagnosis is often impossible; when a person presents with low back or knee pain, special {\dots}},

Primary care providers (PCPs) who wish to avoid prescribing opioids and other medications typically have few options for their cLBP patients. We present the protocol of a pragmatic clinical trial entitled OPTIMUM (Optimizing Pain Treatment In Medical settings Using Mindfulness). OPTIMUM is offered online via telehealth and includes medical group visits (MGV) with a PCP and a mindfulness meditation intervention modeled on MBSR for persons with cLBP. In diverse health-care settings in the US, such as a safety net hospital, federally qualified health centers, and a large academic health system, 450 patients will be assigned randomly to the MGV~+~MBSR or to usual PCP care alone. Participants will complete self-report surveys at baseline, following the 8-week program, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Health care utilization data will be obtained through electronic health records and via brief monthly surveys completed by participants. The primary outcome measure is the PEG (Pain, enjoyment, and general activity) at the 6-month follow-up. Additionally, we will assess psychological function, healthcare resource use, and opioid prescriptions. This trial, which is part of the NIH HEAL Initiative, has the potential to enhance primary care treatment of cLBP by combining PCP visits with a non-pharmacological treatment modeled on MBSR. Because it is offered online and integrated into primary care, it is expected to be scalable and accessible to underserved patients. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT 04129450.},

This study compared the empathy, telepresence, and eye gaze patterns of clients in simulated VC teletherapy sessions where eye contact was altered or facilitated. Forty-two would-be clients met with one of four therapists in training for one 20-min simulated teletherapy session taking place via VC. The session either altered or facilitated eye contact perception by manipulating the positioning of the webcams and of the clients in their chair. Eye-tracking data focusing on the eyes, face, and general body regions of interest were obtained for 25 clients. The results show that facilitating eye contact in VC did not increase the clients' perceptions of empathy or telepresence. However, empathy was associated with greater time spent looking at the eyes and faces of the therapists, but only in the sessions facilitating eye contact. We suggest that clients successfully rely on other verbal and nonverbal cues to detect therapist empathy when eye contact is altered in teletherapy sessions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly limited patients' access to care for spine-related symptoms and disorders. However, physical distancing between clinicians and patients with spine-related symptoms is not solely limited to restrictions imposed by pandemic-related lockdowns. In most low- and middle-income countries, as well as many underserved marginalized communities in high-income countries, there is little to no access to clinicians trained in evidence-based care for people experiencing spinal pain. OBJECTIVE:The aim of this study is to describe the development and present the components of evidence-based patient and clinician guides for the management of spinal disorders where in-person care is not available. METHODS:Ultimately, two sets of guides were developed (one for patients and one for clinicians) by extracting information from the published Global Spine Care Initiative (GSCI) papers. An international, interprofessional team of 29 participants from 10 countries on 4 continents participated. The team included practitioners in family medicine, neurology, physiatry, rheumatology, psychology, chiropractic, physical therapy, and yoga, as well as epidemiologists, research methodologists, and laypeople. The participants were invited to review, edit, and comment on the guides in an open iterative consensus process. RESULTS:The Patient Guide is a simple 2-step process. The first step describes the nature of the symptoms or concerns. The second step provides information that a patient can use when considering self-care, determining whether to contact a clinician, or considering seeking emergency care. The Clinician Guide is a 5-step process: (1) Obtain and document patient demographics, location of primary clinical symptoms, and psychosocial information. (2) Review the symptoms noted in the patient guide. (3) Determine the GSCI classification of the patient's spine-related complaints. (4) Ask additional questions to determine the GSCI subclassification of the symptom pattern. (5) Consider appropriate treatment interventions. CONCLUSIONS:The Patient and Clinician Guides are designed to be sufficiently clear to be useful to all patients and clinicians, irrespective of their location, education, professional qualifications, and experience. However, they are comprehensive enough to provide guidance on the management of all spine-related symptoms or disorders, including triage for serious and specific diseases. They are consistent with widely accepted evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. They also allow for adequate documentation and medical record keeping. These guides should be of value during periods of government-mandated physical or social distancing due to infectious diseases, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. They should also be of value in underserved communities in high-, middle-, and low-income countries where there is a dearth of accessible trained spine care clinicians. These guides have the potential to reduce the overutilization of unnecessary and expensive interventions while empowering patients to self-manage uncomplicated spinal pain with the assistance of their clinician, either through direct in-person consultation or via telehealth communication.},

  abstract = {Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monitor discharged patients and manage their recovery. As a result, it is sufficient to state that telemedicine can create a win-win situation. This paper aims to explore the significant capabilities, features with treatment workflow, and barriers to the adoption of telemedicine in Healthcare. The paper identifies seventeen significant applications of telemedicine in Healthcare. Telemedicine is described as a medical practitioner to diagnose and treat patients in a remote area. Using health apps for scheduled follow-up visits makes doctors and patients more effective and improves the probability of follow-up, reducing missing appointments and optimising patient outcomes. Patients should have an accurate medical history and show the doctor any prominent rashes, bruises, or other signs that need attention through the excellent quality audio-video system. Further, practitioners need file management and a payment gateway system. Telemedicine technologies allow patients and doctors both to review the treatment process. However, this technology supplements physical consultation and is in no way a substitute for a physical consultation. Today this technology is a safe choice for patients who cannot go to the doctor or sit at home, especially during a pandemic.},

For example, sensors that are located in a patient's home or that interface with the patient's body to detect safety issues or medical emergencies may inadvertently transmit sensitive information about household activities. Similarly, routine data transmissions from an app or medical device, such as an insulin pump, may be shared with third-party advertisers. Without adequate security and privacy protections for underlying telehealth data and systems, providers and patients will lack trust in the use of telehealth solutions. Although some federal and state guidelines for telehealth security and privacy have been established, many gaps remain. No federal agency currently has authority to enact privacy and security requirements to cover the telehealth ecosystem. This article examines privacy risks and security threats to telehealth applications and summarizes the extent to which technical controls and federal law adequately address these risks. We argue for a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for telehealth, developed and enforced by a single federal entity, the Federal Trade Commission, to bolster trust and fully realize the benefits of telehealth.},

  abstract = {Low back pain is a very common symptom. It occurs in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries and all age groups from children to the elderly population. Globally, years lived with disability caused by low back pain increased by 54\% between 1990 and 2015, mainly because of population increase and ageing, with the biggest increase seen in low-income and middle-income countries. Low back pain is now the leading cause of disability worldwide. For nearly all people with low back pain, it is not possible to identify a speci c nociceptive cause. Only a small proportion of people have a well understood pathological cause---eg, a vertebral fracture, malignancy, or infection. People with physically demanding jobs, physical and mental comorbidities, smokers, and obese individuals are at greatest risk of reporting low back pain. Disabling low back pain is over-represented among people with low socioeconomic status. Most people with new episodes of low back pain recover quickly; however, recurrence is common and in a small proportion of people, low back pain becomes persistent and disabling. Initial high pain intensity, psychological distress, and accompanying pain at multiple body sites increases the risk of persistent disabling low back pain. Increasing evidence shows that central pain-modulating mechanisms and pain cognitions have important roles in the development of persistent disabling low back pain. Cost, health-care use, and disability from low back pain vary substantially between countries and are in uenced by local culture and social systems, as well as by beliefs about cause and e ect. Disability and costs attributed to low back pain are projected to increase in coming decades, in particular in low-income and middle-income countries, where health and other systems are often fragile and not equipped to cope with this growing burden. Intensi ed research e orts and global initiatives are clearly needed to address the burden of low back pain as a public health problem.},

  abstract = {Background Telerehabilitation is perceived as less effective than in-person care for musculoskeletal problems. We aimed to determine if physiotherapy video conferencing consultations were non-inferior to in-person consultations for chronic knee pain. Methods In this non-inferiority randomised controlled trial, we recruited primary care physiotherapists from 27 Australian clinics. Using computer-generated blocks, participants with chronic knee pain consistent with osteoarthritis were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by physiotherapist and clinic) in-person or telerehabilitation (ie, video conferencing) physiotherapist consultations. Participants and physiotherapists were unmasked to group assignment. Both groups had five consultations over 3 months for strengthening, physical activity, and education. Primary outcomes were knee pain (on a numerical rating scale of 0--10) and physical function (using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index of 0--68) at 3 months after randomisation. Primary analysis was by modified intention-to-treat using all available data. This trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12619001240134. Findings Between Dec 10, 2019, and June 17, 2022, 394 adults were enrolled, with 204 allocated to in-person care and 190 to telerehabilitation. 15 primary care physiotherapists were recruited. At 3 months, 383 (97\%) participants provided information for primary outcomes and both groups reported improved pain (mean change 2{$\cdot$}98, SD 2{$\cdot$}23 for in-person care and 3{$\cdot$}14, 1{$\cdot$}87 for telerehabilitation) and function (10{$\cdot$}20, 11{$\cdot$}63 and 10{$\cdot$}75, 9{$\cdot$}62, respectively). Telerehabilitation was non-inferior for pain (mean difference 0{$\cdot$}16, 95\% CI --0{$\cdot$}26 to 0{$\cdot$}57) and function (1{$\cdot$}65, --0{$\cdot$}23 to 3{$\cdot$}53). The number of participants reporting adverse events was similar between groups (40 [21\%] for in-person care and 35 [19\%] for telerehabilitation) and none were serious. Interpretation Telerehabilitation with a physiotherapist is non-inferior to in-person care for chronic knee pain. Funding National Health and Medical Research Council.},

However, there is a plethora of technical options for practitioners to choose from, and there are various challenges in the adaptation of clinical processes as well as several special considerations regarding regulatory context and patient management. Practitioners are faced with a lack of high-quality peer-reviewed resources to guide the planning and practical implementation of remote consultations.           Objectives:~           This Clinical Update seeks to provide practical guidance for the planning and implementation of remote consultations for the management and treatment of people with musculoskeletal pain.           Methods:~           Recommendations are based on a brief overview of the relevant research regarding phone and video consultations for musculoskeletal practice and derived from the literature, relevant guidelines, and practical experience.           Results:~           The technical feasibility of remote consultations for musculoskeletal complaints is good, patient satisfaction is high, and a growing body of evidence supports its comparative effectiveness to in-person consultations in some circumstances for improving pain and functioning. We consider in detail practical aspects such as the choosing of hardware and software, we touch on the legal and regulatory context, and we focus on the adaptation of clinical processes and communication.           Conclusion:~           This Clinical Update draws together best-practice evidence in a practically applicable format, enabling therapists who are working with people with pain to directly apply this knowledge to their individual clinical settings and the requirements of their patients.},

  abstract = {Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telehealth for patient visits grew rapidly and served an important role as a valuable and necessary resource. Although clinical documentation is critical for telehealth patient visits, there is limited information about how healthcare facilities manage telehealth patient visit documentation, technology used for telehealth visits, and challenges encountered with telehealth patient visit documentation. This study aimed to assess the use of telehealth during the pandemic, the quality of clinical documentation in telehealth practice and to identify challenges and issues encountered with telehealth patient visits in order to develop a strategy for best practices for telehealth documentation and data management. Methods Data were collected for this cross-sectional study in January-February 2021 via a self-designed survey of administrators/managers from physicians' offices and mental health facilities. Survey questions included four categories: health organization demographic information; telehealth visits; clinical documentation for telehealth visit; and challenges and barriers related to telehealth documentation technology use. Results Of 76 respondents, more than half (62\%) of the healthcare facilities started using telehealth for patient visits within one year of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 94\% of respondents indicating an increased use of telehealth for patient visits since the pandemic. The most common types of telehealth patient care provided during the pandemic included pediatrics, primary care, cardiology, and women's health. The most consistent data documentation of telehealth visits included: date of service, patient identification number, communication methods, patient informed consent, diagnosis and impression, evaluation results, and recommendations. The telehealth visit data was most commonly used for patient care and clinical practice, billing and reimbursement, quality improvement and patient satisfaction, and administrative planning. The top barriers to telehealth use by the healthcare professionals included patient challenges with telehealth services, such as inequities in quality of technology, lack of patient understanding, and lack of patient satisfaction; this was followed by frustration with constant updates of telehealth guidelines and procedures, understanding required telehealth documentation for reimbursement purposes, payer denial for telehealth visits, and legal and risk issues. Conclusions Findings from this study can assist government entities, policymakers, and healthcare organizations in developing and advocating best practices in telehealth usage and clinical documentation improvement strategies.},

  abstract = {Background: Digitally supported self-management tailored to an individual's need, in addition to usual care, may reduce pain-related disability compared to usual care alone, and patients with low back pain (LBP) using mobile health (mHealth) solutions express positive experiences. Hence, implementing mHealth solutions designed to support self-management is desirable from a clinical and patient perspective. Easily accessible mHealth solutions that can support the self-management of patients with LBP are available, but interest may be subgroup specific. Understanding the characteristics and preferences of patients with LBP labeled as interested may help to reach relevant LBP patient groups and inform the development and implementation of effective interventions with mHealth for patients with LBP. Objective: This study aims to explore the proportion of patients with LBP labeled as interested in testing an mHealth solution designed to support self-management in addition to usual care and to assess how these patients differ from those who were labeled as not interested. Methods: This exploratory cross-sectional study analyzed demographic and patient-reported outcomes from the SpineData registry, a Danish registry of patients with LBP in an outpatient setting. Between February and December 2019, the SpineData registry was used to assess the preliminary eligibility of patients for a clinical trial (selfBACK). Patients were labeled as interested or uninterested depending on if they responded to an invitation to be tested for eligibility for the trial Outcomes were selected from the International Classification of Functioning core set of LBP using a clinical approach. Associations were assessed in a backward selection process, and the proportion of variance explained was assessed with pseudo-R2 statistic. Results: This study included 843 patients, with 181 (21\%) individuals labeled as interested in participating in the selfBACK trial. Notably, the cohort labeled as interested differed from their uninterested counterparts in two key aspects: age (36-65 years: 116/181, 64.1\% vs 347/662, 52.4\%; P=.003) and smoking status (smokers: 22/181, 12.5\% vs 174/662, 26.6\%; P\&lt;.001). Those aged 36-65 years had higher odds of being labeled as interested compared to individuals aged 18-35 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.43, 95\% CI 0.26-0.71) and those 65 years or older (OR 0.77, 95\% CI 0.53-1.15). Nevertheless, age accounted for only a modest proportion of variance (R2=0.014). Smokers demonstrated lower odds of being labeled as interested (OR 0.39, 95\% CI 0.24-0.64), with smoking status explaining a similarly small proportion of variance (R2=0.019). Collectively, age and smoking status accounted for 3.3\% of the variance. Conclusions: Our investigation revealed that 181 (21\%) individuals with LBP invited to participate in the mHealth solution trial for self-management expressed interest. Generally, the characteristics of those labeled as interested and uninterested were comparable. Of note, patients aged 36-65 years had a higher frequency of being labeled as interested compared to their younger and older counterparts.},

This study compared student learning outcomes between the traditional approach and learning management system multimedia instruction in Doctor of Physical Therapy students. Using a cross-over design, half of the psychomotor techniques were instructed using each instructional strategy for cohort one and switched for cohort two. A practical examination compared student performance. Live demonstration scores were slightly higher than the LMS-embedded multimedia scores for the upper extremity techniques. While the differences were statistically significant, the partial eta squared value is small. This pattern was reversed for the lower extremity with slightly lower live demonstration scores compared to the LMS-embedded multimedia instruction. However, the difference between means was not statistically significant, revealing similar outcomes for both instructional strategies.},

During an emergency declaration made March 17, 2020, the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS) stated the need for providers to use telemedicine to provide patients care in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and other settings across the states. Additionally, new policies have been implemented to better facilitate patient care, safety, and privacy., The convenience provided by this low resource modality facilitates the intercommunication between physicians and offers a suitable alternative for patients who are medically or socially unable to see providers in person. However, given the nature of the practice, much consideration is needed to build patient relationships and comfort. In the future, the impact of telemedicine on healthcare environments cannot be overstated, especially in hospice and nursing home settings where it stands to improve treatment efficacy and monitoring for the elderly. Newer inventions such as the remote patient monitoring system can act as safety nets for clinic patients, while improving accessibility of electronic health records (EHRs) will dramatically augment available treatment options.~However, the spread of telehealth relies on community reimbursement and the ability for physicians to consistently offer the same services that are available in person. Additionally, it is imperative that physicians and other healthcare professionals integrate these new technologies into their fields while also maintaining the ethics of patient security and autonomy.},

However, the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent explosion of telehealth services also provide an unparalleled opportunity to consider ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) beyond immediate needs. Ethicists, informaticians, and others can learn from experience, and evaluate information technology practices and evidence on which to base policy and standards, identify significant values and issues, and revise ethical guidelines. This paper builds on professional organizations' guidelines and ELSI scholarship to develop emerging concerns illuminated by current experience. Four ethical themes characterized previous literature: quality of care and the doctor--patient relationship, access, consent, and privacy. More attention is needed to these and to expanding the scope of ethical analysis to include health information technologies. An applied ethics approach to ELSI would addresses context-specific issues and the relationships between people and technologies, and facilitate effective and ethical institutionalization of telehealth and other health information technologies.},

  abstract = {Background Information technologies have been vital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth and telemedicine services, especially, fulfilled their promise by allowing patients to receive advice and care at a distance, making it safer for all concerned. Over the preceding years, professional societies, governments, and scholars examined ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) related to telemedicine and telehealth. Primary concerns evident from reviewing this literature have been quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. Objectives To identify and summarize ethical, legal, and social issues related to information technology in healthcare, as exemplified by telehealth and telemedicine. To expand on prior analyses and address gaps illuminated by the COVID-19 experience. To propose future research directions. Methods Literature was identified through searches, forward and backward citation chaining, and the author's knowledge of scholars and works in the area. EU and professional organizations' guidelines, and nineteen scholarly papers were examined and categories created to identify ethical, legal, and social issues they addressed. A synthesis matrix was developed to categorize issues addressed by each source. Results A synthesis matrix was developed and issues categorized as: quality of care, consent and autonomy, access to care and technology, legal and regulatory, clinician responsibilities, patient responsibilities, changed relationships, commercialization, policy, information needs, and evaluation, with subcategories that fleshed out each category. The literature primarily addressed quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. Other identified considerations were little discussed. These and newer concerns include: usability, tailoring services to each patient, curriculum and training, implementation, commercialization, and licensing and liability. The need for interoperability, data availability, cybersecurity, and informatics infrastructure also is more apparent. These issues are applicable to other information technologies in healthcare. Conclusions Clinicians and organizations need updated guidelines for ethical use of telemedicine and telehealth care, and decision- and policy-makers need evidence to inform decisions. The variety of newly implemented telemedicine services is an on-going natural experiment presenting an unparalleled opportunity to develop an evidence-based way forward. The paper recommends evaluation using an applied ethics, context-sensitive approach that explores interactions among multiple factors and considerations. It suggests evaluation questions to investigate ethical, social, and legal issues through multi-method, sociotechnical, interpretive and ethnographic, and interactionist evaluation approaches. Such evaluation can help telehealth, and other information technologies, be integrated into healthcare ethically and effectively.},

  abstract = {Background: Patient education, home-based exercise therapy, and advice on returning to normal activities are established physiotherapeutic treatment options for patients with nonspecific low back pain (LBP). However, the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions on health-related outcomes largely depends on patient self-management and adherence to exercise and physical activity recommendations. e-Exercise LBP is a recently developed stratified blended care intervention comprising a smartphone app integrated with face-to-face physiotherapy treatment. Following the promising effects of web-based applications on patients' self-management skills and adherence to exercise and physical activity recommendations, it is hypothesized that e-Exercise LBP will improve patients' physical functioning. Objective: This study aims to investigate the short-term (3 months) effectiveness of stratified blended physiotherapy (e-Exercise LBP) on physical functioning in comparison with face-to-face physiotherapy in patients with nonspecific LBP. Methods: The study design was a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial with intention-to-treat analysis. Patients with nonspecific LBP aged {$\geq$}18 years were asked to participate in the study. The patients were treated with either stratified blended physiotherapy or face-to-face physiotherapy. Both interventions were conducted according to the Dutch physiotherapy guidelines for nonspecific LBP. Blended physiotherapy was stratified according to the patients' risk of developing persistent LBP using the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool. The primary outcome was physical functioning (Oswestry Disability Index, range 0-100). Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, fear-avoidance beliefs, and self-reported adherence. Measurements were taken at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up. Results: Both the stratified blended physiotherapy group (104/208, 50\%) and the face-to-face physiotherapy group (104/208, 50\%) had improved clinically relevant and statistically significant physical functioning; however, there was no statistically significant or clinically relevant between-group difference (mean difference -1.96, 95\% CI -4.47 to 0.55). For the secondary outcomes, stratified blended physiotherapy showed statistically significant between-group differences in fear-avoidance beliefs and self-reported adherence. In patients with a high risk of developing persistent LBP (13/208, 6.3\%), stratified blended physiotherapy showed statistically significant between-group differences in physical functioning (mean difference -16.39, 95\% CI -27.98 to -4.79) and several secondary outcomes. Conclusions: The stratified blended physiotherapy intervention e-Exercise LBP is not more effective than face-to-face physiotherapy in patients with nonspecific LBP in improving physical functioning in the short term. For both stratified blended physiotherapy and face-to-face physiotherapy, within-group improvements were clinically relevant. To be able to decide whether e-Exercise LBP should be implemented in daily physiotherapy practice, future research should focus on the long-term cost-effectiveness and determine which patients benefit most from stratified blended physiotherapy.

The focus of this study was to evaluate if the new asynchronous format satisfied the educational needs of the residents compared to traditional lecture (face-to-face) and synchronous (distance learning) formats. Lectures were delivered to 219 dental residents employing face-to-face and synchronous formats, as well as the new asynchronous format; 169 (77 percent) participated in the study. Outcomes were assessed with pretests, posttests, and individual lecture surveys. Results found the residents preferred face-to-face and asynchronous formats to the synchronous format in terms of effectiveness and clarity of presentations. This preference was directly related to the residents' perception of how well the technology worked in each format. The residents also rated the quality of student-instructor and student-student interactions in the synchronous and asynchronous formats significantly higher after taking the lecture series than they did before taking it. However, they rated the face-to-face format as significantly more conducive to student-instructor and student-student interaction. While the study found technology had a major impact on the efficacy of this curricular model, the results suggest that the asynchronous format can be an effective way to teach a postgraduate course.},

  abstract = {Question Do people with musculoskeletal conditions better adhere to their home exercise programs when these are provided to them on an app with remote support compared to paper handouts? Design Randomised, parallel-group trial with intention-to-treat analysis. Participants Eighty participants with upper or lower limb musculoskeletal conditions were recruited to the trial. Each participant was prescribed a 4-week home exercise program by a physiotherapist at a tertiary teaching hospital in Australia. Participants were randomly assigned via a computer-generated concealed block randomisation procedure to either intervention (n=40) or control (n=40) groups. Intervention Participants in the intervention group received their home exercise programs on an app linked to the freely available website www.physiotherapyexercises.com. They also received supplementary phone calls and motivational text messages. Participants in the control group received their home exercise programs as a paper handout. Outcome measures Blinded assessors collected outcome measures at baseline and 4 weeks. The primary outcome was self-reported exercise adherence. There were five secondary outcomes, which captured functional performance, disability, patient satisfaction, perceptions of treatment effectiveness, and different aspects of adherence. Results Outcomes were available on 77 participants. The mean between-group difference for self-reported exercise adherence at 4 weeks was 1.3/11 points (95\% CI 0.2 to 2.3), favouring the intervention group. The mean between-group difference for function was 0.9/11 points (95\% CI 0.1 to 1.7) on the Patient-Specific Functional Scale, also favouring the intervention group. There were no significant between-group differences for the remaining outcomes. Conclusion People with musculoskeletal conditions adhere better to their home exercise programs when the programs are provided on an app with remote support compared to paper handouts; however, the clinical importance of this added adherence is unclear.

This study investigated the: (i) test--retest reliability of performance-based tests via telehealth, and (ii) agreement between scores obtained via telehealth and in-person.                                         Methods               Fifty-seven adults aged {$\geq$}45 years with chronic lower limb musculoskeletal pain underwent three testing sessions: one in-person and two via videoconferencing. Tests included 30-s chair stand, 5-m fast-paced walk, stair climb, timed up and go, step test, timed single-leg stance, and calf raises. Test--retest reliability and agreement were assessed via intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC; lower limit of 95\% confidence interval (CI) {$\geq$}0.70 considered acceptable). ICCs were interpreted as poor ({$<$}0.5), moderate (0.5--0.75), good (0.75--0.9), or excellent ({$>$}0.9).                                         Results               Test--retest reliability was good-excellent with acceptable lower CI for stair climb test, timed up and go, right leg timed single-leg stance, and calf raises (ICC\,=\,0.84--0.91, 95\% CI lower limit\,=\,0.71--0.79). Agreement between telehealth and in-person was good-excellent with acceptable lower CI for 30-s chair stand, left leg single-leg stance, and calf raises (ICC\,=\,0.82--0.91, 95\% CI lower limit\,=\,0.71--0.85).                                         Discussion               Stair climb, timed up and go, right leg timed single-leg stance, and calf raise tests have acceptable reliability for use via telehealth in research and clinical practice. If re-testing via a different mode (telehealth/in-person), clinicians and researchers should consider using the 30-s chair stand test, left leg timed single-leg stance, and calf raise tests.},

  abstract = {Objective Physiotherapists typically prescribe exercise therapy for people with osteoarthritis (OA) via face-to-face consultations. This study aimed to explore peoples' perceptions of exercise therapy delivered by physiotherapists via telephone for their knee OA. Design A qualitative study (based on interpretivist methodology) embedded within a randomised controlled trial. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 20 people with knee OA who had received exercise advice and support from one of eight physiotherapists via telephone over 6~months. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Results Although people with OA were initially sceptical about receiving exercise therapy via telephone, they described mostly positive experiences, valuing the convenience and accessibility. However, some desired visual contact with the physiotherapist and suggested including video-conferencing calls or an initial in-person clinic visit. Participants valued the sense of undivided focus and attention they received from the physiotherapist and believed that they were able to communicate effectively via telephone. Participants felt confident performing their exercise program without supervision and described benefits including increased muscular strength, improved pain, and ability to perform tasks that they had not been previously able to. Conclusions People with knee OA held mostly positive perceptions about receiving exercise therapy from a physiotherapist via telephone, suggesting that such a service is broadly acceptable to consumers. Such services were generally not viewed as a substitute for face-to-face physiotherapy care, but rather as a new option that could increase accessibility of physiotherapy services, particularly for follow-up consultations.},

However, these systems are limited in that they only rely on sensors and medical devices to obtain vital signs. New research and development are urgently needed to offer more effective and meaningful interactions between patients, medical professionals and other individuals around the patients. Social networking with Web 2.0 technologies and methods can meet these demands, and help to develop a more complete view of the patient. Also many people, including the elderly, may be resistant to change, which can reduce the efficacy of telehealth systems. Persuasive technology and mechanisms are urgently needed to counter this resistance and promote healthy lifestyles. In this paper, we propose the participatory and persuasive telehealth system as a solution for these two limitations. By integrating connected health solutions with social networking and adding persuasive influence, we increase the chances for effective interventions and behavior alterations.},

  abstract = {Background Evidenced-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of low back pain (LBP) consistently suggest educating patients about their back pain, its natural course, and providing advice to keep active and continue working. Despite this evidence, clinicians routinely do not follow these recommendations resulting in ineffective and fragmented care. GLA:D{\textregistered} Back, a standardized care package, was originally developed in Denmark to assist clinicians in implementing evidence-based care. This study will evaluate the feasibility of implementing the English version of the Danish GLA:D{\textregistered} Back program in Alberta, Canada. Methods Thirty-five clinicians from nineteen clinics in Alberta, Canada, participated. Feasibility of program implementation, our primary objective, was evaluated within 3 months. Feasibility success was defined as 50\% clinician/clinic adoption in addition to 66--88 enrolled participants registered in the database. Our secondary objectives included collecting data pertaining to clinician confidence, attitudes and behaviour of treating patients, perceived barriers and facilitators of program in addition to collecting patient-data regarding pain, function, general health and self-efficacy. Results The majority of the clinics (15/19, 79\%) offered GLA:D{\textregistered} Back to their patients within the study period. Of the participating clinicians, GLA:D{\textregistered} Back was delivered by (25/35, 71\%) of clinicians. In total, 78 patients were enrolled in the program and (69/78, 88\%) participants attended the final assessment. Secondarily, clinicians demonstrated a biomedical and behavioural orientation along with high confidence when treating LBP patients while patient outcomes trended toward improvement. Conclusion The English translation of the Danish GLA:D Back program was feasible for Albertan clinicians to implement into practice in both urban and rural settings.},

  abstract = {Background: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of worldwide years lost because of disability, with a tremendous economic burden for health care systems. Digital therapeutic care (DTC) programs provide a scalable, universally accessible, and low-cost approach to the multidisciplinary treatment of LBP. Moreover, novel decision support interventions such as personalized feedback messages, push notifications, and data-driven activity recommendations amplify DTC by guiding the user through the program while aiming to increase overall engagement and sustainable behavior change. Objective: This systematic review aims to synthesize recent scientific literature on the impact of DTC apps for people with LBP and outline the implementation of add-on decision support interventions, including their effect on user retention and attrition rates. Methods: We searched bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, from March 1, 2016, to October 15, 2020, in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and conducted this review based on related previously published systematic reviews. Besides randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we also included study designs with the evidence level of at least a retrospective comparative study. This enables the consideration of real-world user-generated data and provides information regarding the adoption and effectiveness of DTC apps in a real-life setting. For the appraisal of the risk of bias, we used the Risk of Bias 2 Tool and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions Tool for the RCTs and nonrandomized trials, respectively. The included studies were narratively synthesized regarding primary and secondary outcome measures, DTC components, applied decision support interventions, user retention, and attrition rates. Results: We retrieved 1388 citations, of which 12 studies are included in this review. Of the 12 studies, 6 (50\%) were RCTs and 6 (50\%) were nonrandomized trials. In all included studies, lower pain levels and increased functionality compared with baseline values were observed in the DTC intervention group. A between-group comparison revealed significant improvements in pain and functionality levels in 67\% (4/6) of the RCTs. The study population was mostly homogeneous, with predominantly female, young to middle-aged participants of normal to moderate weight. The methodological quality assessment revealed moderate to high risks of biases, especially in the nonrandomized trials. Conclusions: This systematic review demonstrates the benefits of DTC for people with LBP. There is also evidence that decision support interventions benefit overall engagement with the app and increase participants' ability to self-manage their recovery process. Finally, including retrospective evaluation studies of real-world user-generated data in future systematic reviews of digital health intervention trials can reveal new insights into the benefits, challenges, and real-life adoption of DTC programs.},

Based on the theory of the parasocial relationship, we investigated the influence of social attractiveness (SA), physical attractiveness (PA), task attractiveness (TA), and content quality (CQ) of fitness influencers on the parasocial relationships (PSRs) between viewers and fitness influencers on social media and whether PSRs positively contribute to viewers' exercise intentions (EI). The results revealed that SA, PA, TA, and CQ have positive influences on PSRs and CQ; PSRs directly contribute to EI; and PSRs have a mediating effect between EI and CQ.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES:To identify common recommendations for high-quality care for the most common musculoskeletal (MSK) pain sites encountered by clinicians in emergency and primary care (spinal (lumbar, thoracic and cervical), hip/knee (including osteoarthritis [OA] and shoulder) from contemporary, high-quality clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). DESIGN:Systematic review, critical appraisal and narrative synthesis of MSK pain CPG recommendations. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:Included MSK pain CPGs were written in English, rated as high quality, published from 2011, focused on adults and described development processes. Excluded CPGs were for: traumatic MSK pain, single modalities (eg, surgery), traditional healing/medicine, specific disease processes (eg, inflammatory arthropathies) or those that required payment. DATA SOURCES:Four scientific databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Physiotherapy Evidence Database) and four guideline repositories. RESULTS:6232 records were identified, 44 CPGs were appraised and 11 were rated as high quality (low back pain: 4, OA: 4, neck: 2 and shoulder: 1). We identified 11 recommendations for MSK pain care: ensure care is patient centred, screen for red flag conditions, assess psychosocial factors, use imaging selectively, undertake a physical examination, monitor patient progress, provide education/information, address physical activity/exercise, use manual therapy only as an adjunct to other treatments, offer high-quality non-surgical care prior to surgery and try to keep patients at work. CONCLUSION:These 11 recommendations guide healthcare consumers, clinicians, researchers and policy makers to manage MSK pain. This should improve the quality of care of MSK pain.},

  abstract = {A real-time 3D Telemedicine system~--~leveraging Microsoft's Holoportation™ communication technology~--~enabled an~international multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT) to consult with complex reconstructive patients before, during, and after an overseas surgical collaboration. Methods A proof-of-concept international 3D MDT clinic took place in November 2022, between the Canniesburn Plastic Surgery Unit, UK, and the National Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burns Centre, Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana. The 3D system was utilised 1) previsit to assess patients and enable logistical planning, 2) on-site in Ghana to further allow patients to see themselves and proposed operations in 3D, and 3) post~visit to debrief the team and patients. Results Four Ghana patients were followed through their patient journey (mandibular ameloblastoma, sarcoma thigh, maxillary tumour, sarcoma back). Thirteen participants (four patients, four Ghana clinicians, and five UK clinicians) completed feedback on the 3D MDT. Outcome measures were rated highly with satisfaction 84.31/100, perceived benefit 4.54/5, overall quality 127.3/147 (Telehealth Usability Questionnaire), and usability 83.2/100 (System Usability Scale). These data show close alignment with that previously published on high-income countries. Conclusions This novel technology has the potential to enhance the delivery of overseas surgical visits to low-to-middle-income countries, by improving planning, informed discussion with patients, expert consensus on complex cases, and fostering engagement with professionals who may be thousands of miles away. This is the first demonstration that real-time 3D Telemedicine can both work, and enhance care within an international MDT clinic, and may thus enable change in the approach to overseas surgical collaborations.},

Various high-quality randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have shown increasing efficacy of PNE decreasing pain, disability, pain catastrophization, movement restrictions, and healthcare utilization. Research studies, however, by virtue of their design, are very controlled environments and, therefore, in contrast to the ever-increasing evidence for PNE, little is known about the clinical application of this emerging therapy. In contrast, case studies, case series, and expert opinion and perspectives by authorities in the world of pain science provide clinicians with a glimpse into potential ``real'' clinical application of PNE in the face of the ever-increasing chronic pain epidemic. By taking the material from the randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, case series, case studies, and expert opinion, this article aims to provide a proposed layout of the clinical application of PNE. The article systematically discusses key elements of PNE including examination, educational content, and delivery methods, merging of PNE with movement, goal setting, and progression. This perspectives article concludes with a call for research into the clinical application of PNE.},

Methods---Data from the 2021 and 2022 National Health Interview Survey were used to assess changes between these 2 years in the percentage of adults who used telemedicine in the previous 12 months, by sex, age, race and Hispanic origin, family income, education, region of residence, urbanization level, and health insurance coverage. Results---Overall, the percentage of adults who used telemedicine in the past 12 months decreased from 37.0\% in 2021 to 30.1\% in 2022. This pattern was observed across several sociodemographic and geographic characteristics, such as sex, family income, education, region, and urbanization level. Women, adults with a college degree or higher, and adults living in more urban areas were all more likely to use telemedicine in 2022. In 2021 and 2022, uninsured adults ages 18--64 were less likely to use telemedicine compared with those who had private or public insurance, while adults age 65 and older who had Medicare only were less likely to use telemedicine compared with those with other types of insurance. However, for both age groups, telemedicine use decreased from 2021 to 2022 for all insurance types except public coverage for adults ages 18--64. Summary---National Health Interview Survey data may be used to monitor national trends and understand patterns of telemedicine use by sociodemographic and geographic characteristics as the transition forward from the global COVID-19 pandemic continues.},

This study examines the relationship between real-time interaction, user perceptions, user intention to keep using live streaming, and whether this relationship differs between a live and a virtual live streaming environment. Using partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modelling (SEM), this paper analyses 240 valid questionnaire responses and finds that there is a link between real-time interactions, visual stimuli, and users' sustained engagement. This shows that users' active interactions while watching live streaming videos significantly affect their perceptions of social presence and trust, which in turn, affect their sustained engagement behaviour. These effects were found to vary with differences in the live streaming environment. The findings of this paper will play a positive role in understanding the differences between various live streaming environments, in optimizing the design of live streaming content and in improving the perceptions of emotional warmth by live streaming users.},

Using PubMed, the authors identified 53 studies published from September 2013 to June 2019 that informed best practices and priorities for future research on patient engagement with EHR data through patient portals, These studies mostly involved outpatient settings and fell into 3 major categories: interventions to increase use of patient portals, usability testing of portal interfaces, and documentation of patient and clinician barriers to portal use. Interventions that used one-on-one patient training were associated with the highest portal use. Patients with limited health or digital literacy faced challenges to portal use. Clinicians reported a lack of workflows to support patient use of portals in routine practice. These studies suggest that achieving higher rates of patient engagement through EHR portals will require paying more attention to the needs of diverse patients and systematically measuring usability as well as scope of content. Future work should incorporate implementation science approaches and directly address the key role of clinicians and staff in promoting portal use.},

The purpose of this study is to describe a model of integrated care delivered both in-person and virtually at employer-sponsored health centers nationwide. The key outcomes of this analysis were the proportion of all care delivered in-person and virtually by clinical discipline, the types of care and member satisfaction for care delivered in-person and virtually, and a description of the use of multiple clinical disciplines by the employee population. Methods: Retrospective observational study comparing health services utilization of primary care, behavioral health, and physical medicine services both in-person and virtually in employer-sponsored clinics between January 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021. Results: Of the 331,967 visits with employer-sponsored health center staff, 63\% were in-person and 37\% were delivered virtually. Most visits were for primary care services (59.5\%), with physical medicine visits and behavioral health visits accounting for 25.1\% and 15.4\%, respectively. Whereas the preponderance of behavioral health visits were virtual visits (72.5\%), less than a quarter (18.2\%) of physical medicine visits were delivered virtually. 19.6\% of patients were seen by more than two clinical disciplines and 2.6\% were seen by three different disciplines. Overall, patients were highly likely to recommend the health center across both modalities (Net Promoter Score 89.1 for in-person care and 88.4 for virtual care). Discussion: The future of employer-sponsored integrated team-based care may require a hybrid approach that can lean heavily on virtual visits but requires the infrastructure necessary for in-person care.},

  abstract = {Background Telehealth services have helped enable continuity of care during the coronavirus pandemic. We aimed to investigate use and views towards telehealth among allied health clinicians treating people with musculoskeletal conditions during the pandemic. Methods Cross-sectional international survey of allied health clinicians who used telehealth to manage musculoskeletal conditions during the coronavirus pandemic. Questions covered demographics, clinician-related factors (e.g. profession, clinical experience and setting), telehealth use (e.g. proportion of caseload, treatments used), attitudes towards telehealth (Likert scale), and perceived barriers and enablers (open questions). Data were presented descriptively, and an inductive thematic content analysis approach was used for qualitative data, based on the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation Behavioural Model. Results 827 clinicians participated, mostly physiotherapists (82\%) working in Australia (70\%). Most (71\%, 587/827) reported reduced revenue (mean (SD) 62\% (24.7\%)) since the pandemic commenced. Median proportion of people seen via telehealth increased from 0\% pre (IQR 0 to 1) to 60\% during the pandemic (IQR 10 to 100). Most clinicians reported managing common musculoskeletal conditions via telehealth. Less than half (42\%) of clinicians surveyed believed telehealth was as effective as face-to-face care. A quarter or less believed patients value telehealth to the same extent (25\%), or that they have sufficient telehealth training (21\%). Lack of physical contact when working through telehealth was perceived to hamper accurate and effective diagnosis and management. Conclusion Although telehealth was adopted by allied health clinicians during the coronavirus pandemic, we identified barriers that may limit continued telehealth use among allied health clinicians beyond the current pandemic.},

This review aimed to map and synthesize evidence on the use of VCs in upper limb musculoskeletal rehabilitation, describe key characteristics, and identify gaps in the research. Methods This scoping review investigated synchronous rehabilitation consultations performed over VC. All asynchronous, wearable or pre-recorded technology was excluded. CINAHL Complete, Medline, PEDro, Google Scholar and grey literature sources were searched. Screening and data extraction were done by a single researcher. Frequency counts were used to analyse the data. Results Nineteen studies were identified, with patients with shoulder injury/pain most frequently studied. Most sources (n = 9) used bespoke video programmes. Range of motion (ROM) was the most common assessment (n = 10) and exercise prescription (n = 7) was the most common treatment. Benefits included time and cost savings, maintaining therapeutic relationships and increasing patient independence. Most diagnostic assessments, except joint and nerve tension tests, were found to be reliable and valid. Studies noted increased function in activities, decreased pain and increased ROM after VCs. Limitations included restricted `hands-on' treatment, resource and training concerns and limiting patient factors. Conclusions This review mapped available evidence and identified several gaps in the literature. Further robust research into VCs for hand/wrist disorders, ROM assessment and cost-effectiveness is needed.},

  abstract = {The skin is our largest sense organ, and touch is the most interactive of all senses. Not surprisingly, the laying on of hands has been an important part of the physician's toolkit since the dawn of medical care. From the Ebers Papyrus of circa 1550 bce to the ``hand healers'' of classical Greece (whose name kheirourgos eventually spawned our modern term ``surgeons''), touch has been the physician's ``professional secret.'' Not anymore.First the obsolescence of bedside interaction owing to the lure of diagnostic technology, then the ``social distancing'' of COVID-19, and ultimately the expansion of telemedicine have all contributed to separate us from patients. Concerns that closeness might be misinterpreted as sexual advance have prompted institutions to offer chaperones for ``nonsensitive'' areas of the examination, whereas some physicians have started to use gloves for interactions that would not normally require them. The result is such a decline in skin-to-skin contact that one is left to wonder whether today's physicians might be more interested in laying on tools rather than hands. The US editor and author Norman Cousins offered the patient's perspective: ``The physician celebrates computerized tomography. The patient celebrates the outstretched hand.'' In fact, the real question is whether the demise of physical contact might have hurt the patient-physician relationship.},

  abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this review is to systematically explore and summarise the validity and reliability of telerehabilitation (TR)-based physiotherapy assessment for musculoskeletal disorders.MethodA comprehensive systematic literature review was conducted using a number of electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and CINAHL, published between January 2000 and May 2015. The studies examined the validity, inter- and intra-rater reliabilities of TR-based physiotherapy assessment for musculoskeletal conditions were included. Two independent reviewers used the Quality Appraisal Tool for studies of diagnostic Reliability (QAREL) and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool to assess the methodological quality of reliability and validity studies respectively.ResultsA total of 898 hits were achieved, of which 11 articles based on inclusion criteria were reviewed. Nine studies explored the concurrent validity, inter- and intra-rater reliabilities, while two studies examined only the concurrent validity. Reviewed studies were moderate to good in methodological quality. The physiotherapy assessments such as pain, swelling, range of motion, muscle strength, balance, gait and functional assessment demonstrated good concurrent validity. However, the reported concurrent validity of lumbar spine posture, special orthopaedic tests, neurodynamic tests and scar assessments ranged from low to moderate.ConclusionTR-based physiotherapy assessment was technically feasible with overall good concurrent validity and excellent reliability, except for lumbar spine posture, orthopaedic special tests, neurodynamic testa and scar assessment.},

This study compared the effects of Telerehabilitation-Based McKenzie Therapy (TBMT) and Clinic-Based McKenzie Therapy (CBMT) among patients with LBP. Forty-seven consenting patients with chronic LBP who demonstrated 'directional preference' for McKenzie Extension Protocol (MEP) completed this quasi experimental study. The participants were assigned into either the CBMT or TBMT group using block permuted randomization. Participants in the CBMT and TBMT groups received MEP involving a specific sequence of lumbosacral repeated movements in extension aimed to centralize, decrease, or abolish symptoms, thrice weekly for eight weeks. TBMT is a comparable version of CBMT performed in the home with the assistance of a mobile phone app. Outcomes were assessed at the 4th and 8th weeks of the study in terms of Pain Intensity (PI), Back Extensors Muscles' Endurance (BEME), Activity Limitation (AL), Participation Restriction (PR), and General Health Status (GHS). Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at p{\textexclamdown} 0.05. Within-group comparison across baseline, 4th and 8th weeks indicate that both CBMT and TBMT had significant effects on PI (p=0.001), BEME (p=0.001), AL (p=0.001), PR (p=0.001) and GHS (p=0.001) respectively. However, there were no significant differences (p{\textquestiondown}0.05) in the treatment effects between TBMT and CBMT, except for 'vitality' (p=0.011) scale in the GHS where TBMT led to significantly higher mean score. Mobile-app platform of the McKenzie extension protocol has comparable clinical outcomes with the traditional clinic-based McKenzie Therapy, and thus is an effective supplementary platform for care of patients with low-back pain.},

  abstract = {Objective Remote knee osteoarthritis (OA) management programs are becoming more popular. This systematic review examined the efficacy of remote exercise programs for relieving pain in persons with knee OA. Design We conducted a search of studies published between January 1st, 2013 to March 31st, 2021 in PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE. We included randomized trials of patients with knee OA or chronic knee pain, studying interventions with an element of telehealth exercise management, and evaluating knee pain as an outcome. Interventions could include fully remote or both remote and in-person components. We excluded observational cohort studies, pilot studies, and studies with poor Physiotherapy Exercise Database (PEDro) scores. Two reviewers extracted pain data, consisting of mean differences from baseline and between groups, and compared them to minimum clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds. Results We identified 1867 reports, of which eleven trials with a total of 1861 participants met inclusion criteria. Only one trial demonstrated a clinically meaningful change from baseline between groups. Four interventions were found to result in clinically meaningful improvements in pain from baseline. Conclusion This review was limited by variability in outcome measures, intervention content, and comparators. One trial with an inactive control demonstrated clinically meaningful between group differences in pain. All four interventions demonstrating meaningful improvements from baseline included study-initiated communications to discuss and personalize remotely delivered exercise programs. More studies comparing fully or partially remote exercise programs with both active and inactive controls could help optimize the use of remote programs for management of knee OA pain.},

Can we reveal engaging moments of gameplay by observing the way the viewers of the game behave? To address these questions in this paper, we reframe the way gameplay engagement is defined and we view it, instead, through the eyes of a game's live audience. We build prediction models for viewers' engagement based on data collected from the popular battle royale game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds as obtained from the Twitch streaming service. In particular, we collect viewers' chat logs and in-game telemetry data from several hundred matches of five popular streamers (containing over 100,000 game events) and machine learn the mapping between gameplay and viewer chat frequency during play, using small neural network architectures. Our key findings showcase that engagement models trained solely on 40 gameplay features can reach accuracies of up to 80\% on average and 84\% at best. Our models are scalable and generalisable as they perform equally well within- and across-streamers, as well as across streamer play styles.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of a three-month physiotherapist-delivered eHealth physical activity program compared with usual care to improve function in adults with low back pain or knee osteoarthritis in rural Australia. Methods Parallel, two-group, pragmatic, superiority, randomised controlled trial involving three and six-month post-treatment follow-ups. Participants/setting 156 adults with chronic non-specific low back pain (n=97) or knee osteoarthritis (n=59) from rural Australia. Intervention eHealth physical activity and exercise program that included five to eight teleconsultations with a physiotherapist (primary time-point 3 months), or usual care (e.g., general practitioner, physiotherapy, pain medication). Results The primary outcome was the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) (0-30), with a 3-point difference between groups being considered the minimum clinically important difference. Results Participants receiving the eHealth intervention (n=78) reported significantly greater and clinically worthwhile improvements in function (mean between-group difference 3.6; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 5.9) compared to participants receiving usual care (n=78). Small but statistically significantly greater improvements in disability (7.2/100; 95\%CI 2.1 to 12.3), and quality of life (4.5/100; 95\%CI 0.0 to 9.0) also favoured the eHealth group. No clinical or statistical differences between groups were found for the secondary outcomes of pain, coping skills, and physical activity levels. Conclusion An eHealth physiotherapist-delivered intervention is effective and provides clinically meaningful improvements in function compared to usual care for people with musculoskeletal pain in rural communities. These findings highlight the potential for eHealth-based programs to improve access to evidence-based exercise interventions for people with musculoskeletal pain in rural communities.},

Previously, we developed a conceptual model to optimize patient engagement in mHealth apps by incorporating multiple evidence-based methods, including increasing health literacy, enhancing technical competence, and improving feelings about participation in clinical trials. This viewpoint aims to report on a series of exploratory mini-experiments demonstrating the feasibility of testing our previously published engagement conceptual model. We collected data from 6 participants using an app that showed a series of educational videos and obtained additional data via questionnaires to illustrate and pilot the approach. The videos addressed 3 elements shown to relate to engagement in health care app use: increasing health literacy, enhancing technical competence, and improving positive feelings about participation in clinical trials. We measured changes in participants' knowledge and feelings, collected feedback on the videos and content, made revisions based on this feedback, and conducted participant reassessments. The findings support the feasibility of an iterative approach to creating and refining engagement enhancements in mHealth apps. Systematically identifying the key evidence-based elements intended to be included in an app's design and then systematically testing the implantation of each element separately until a satisfactory level of positive impact is achieved is feasible and should be incorporated into standard app design. While mHealth apps have shown promise, participants are more likely to drop out than to be retained. This viewpoint highlights the potential for mHealth researchers to test and refine mHealth apps using approaches to better engage users.},

This study aims to assess the response and impact of COVID-19 on chiropractors internationally, and examines the public health response of chiropractors to the COVID-19 pandemic practising under a musculoskeletal spine-care versus subluxation-based care paradigm.                                         Methods               A survey was distributed to chiropractors in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Hong Kong, United Kingdom and United States (Oct. 2nd--Dec. 22nd, 2020) via professional bodies/publications, and social media. Questions were categorised into three domains: socio-demographic, public health response and business/financial impact. Multivariable logistic regression explored survey items associated with chiropractors practising under different self-reported paradigms.                                         Results               A total of 2061 chiropractors representing four global regions completed the survey. Our recruitment method did not allow the calculation of an accurate response rate. The vast majority initiated COVID-19 infection control changes within their practice setting, including increased disinfecting of treatment equipment (95\%), frequent contact areas (94\%) and increased hand hygiene (94\%). While findings varied by region, most chiropractors (85\%) indicated that they had implemented regulator advice on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Suspension of face-to-face patient care during the peak of the pandemic was reported by 49\% of the participants with 26\% implementing telehealth since the pandemic began. Chiropractors practising under a musculoskeletal spine-care paradigm were more likely to implement some/all regulator advice on patient PPE use (odds ratio [OR]\,=\,3.25; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57, 6.74) and practitioner PPE use (OR\,=\,2.59; 95\% CI 1.32, 5.08); trust COVID-19 public health information provided by government/World Health Organisation/chiropractic bodies (OR\,=\,2.47; 95\% CI 1.49, 4.10), and initiate patient telehealth in response to COVID-19 (OR\,=\,1.46; 95\% CI 1.02, 2.08) compared to those practising under a subluxation-based paradigm.                                         Conclusions               Chiropractors who responded to our survey made substantial infectious control changes in response to COVID-19. However, there was regional variation in the implementation of the advised practitioner and patient use of PPE and limited overall use of telehealth consultations by chiropractors during COVID-19. Musculoskeletal spine-care chiropractors were more adaptive to certain COVID-19 public health changes within their practice setting than subluxation-based chiropractors.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify communication features that may affect the development of the therapeutic relationship during telephone support sessions for people undertaking self-directed therapy. Methods: Recorded telephone support sessions of 61 people with chronic dizziness were analysed for communication behaviour using the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). Working alliance was assessed and was correlated with the RIAS to determine whether communication behaviour affected the therapeutic relationship. Thematic qualitative analysis of support sessions was then carried out to explore the content of sessions with high or low levels of person-centredness. Results: The level of person-centredness was related to the therapeutic relationship. High person-centred sessions were more likely to address concerns and include therapist reassurances about the safety of the treatment and its side effects. Conclusion: It is possible for rehabilitation therapists to build a strong therapeutic relationship very quickly and over the telephone. Person-centred communication is important for the development of the therapeutic relationship during telephone-delivered support. This research suggests how person-centred communicative behaviours, such as reassurance, encouragement and approval could be incorporated into practice.Implications for RehabilitationPerson-centred communication is important for the development of a strong therapeutic relationship during support for self-directed rehabilitation.It is possible for rehabilitation therapists to build a strong therapeutic relationship very quickly and over the telephone.Positive communication behaviours such as encouragement, approval, reassurance of safety, and responsiveness to participant cues aid the therapeutic relationship.

  abstract = {Objective Telehealth has been established as a viable option for improved access and timeliness of care. Physician-guided patient self-evaluation may improve the viability of telehealth evaluation; however, there are little data evaluating the efficacy of self-administered examination (SAE). This study aims to compare the diagnostic accuracy of a patient SAE to a traditional standardised clinical examination (SCE) for evaluation of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS). Methods 75 patients seeking care for hip-related pain were included for participation. All patients underwent both SAE and SCE and were randomised to the order of the examinations. Diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated for both examination group for a final diagnosis of FAIS. Mean diagnostic accuracy results for each group were then compared using Mann-Whitney U non-parametric tests. Results The diagnostic accuracy of individual SAE and SCE manoeuvres varied widely. Both SAE and SCE demonstrated no to moderate change in post-test probability for the diagnosis of FAIS. Although low, SAE demonstrated a statistically greater mean diagnostic accuracy compared with the SCE (53.6\% vs 45.5\%, p=0.02). Conclusion Diagnostic accuracy was statistically significantly higher for the self-exam than for the traditional clinical exam although the difference may not be clinically relevant. Although the mean accuracy remains relatively low for both exams, these values are consistent with hip exam for FAIS reported in the literature. Having established the validity of an SAE, future investigations will need to evaluate implementation in a telehealth setting.},

Eligible studies included those that reported on performing a virtual spine physical examination. Two reviewers independently assessed all potential studies for eligibility and extracted data. The primary outcome of interest was the reliability of the virtual spine physical exam. Secondary outcomes of interest were patient satisfaction with the virtual encounter.Results:A total of 2321 studies were initially screened. After inclusion criteria were applied, 3 studies (88 patients) were included that compared virtual with in-person spine physical examinations. These studies showed acceptable reliability for portions of the low back virtual exam. Patient satisfaction surveys were conducted in 2 of the studies and showed general satisfaction ({$>$}80\% would recommend).Conclusions:These results suggest that the virtual spine examination may be comparable to the in-person physical examination for low back pain, though there is a significant void in the literature regarding the reliability of the physical examination as it pertains to specific surgical pathology of the spine. Because patients are overall satisfied with virtual spine assessments, validating a virtual physical examination of the spine is an important area that requires further research.},

  abstract = {Objective. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of physical therapy delivered via an all telehealth or hybrid format with an all in-person format on movement-evoked pain for individuals with chronic Achilles tendinopathy (AT). Methods. Sixty-six individuals with chronic AT participated (age, 43.4 [SD = 15.4] years; 56\% female; body mass index, 29.9 [SD = 7.7] kg/m2). Participants completed all in-person visits from the initiation of recruitment in September 2019 to March 16, 2020 (in-person group). From March 17 to July 15, 2020, participants completed all telehealth visits (telehealth group). From July 16, 2020, to enrollment completion in December 2020, participants could complete visits all in-person, all telehealth, or a combination of in-person and telehealth (hybrid group) based on their preference. A physical therapist provided 6 to 7 visits, including an exercise program and patient education. Noninferiority analyses of the telehealth and hybrid groups compared with the in-person group were completed for the primary outcome of movement-evoked pain during single-limb heel raises. Results. All groups demonstrated decreases in movement-evoked pain beyond the minimal clinically important difference from baseline to 8 weeks (2 out of 10 on a numeric pain rating scale). Lower bounds of the 95\% CIs for mean differences between groups did not surpass the preestablished noninferiority margin (2 out of 10) for movement-evoked pain in both the telehealth and hybrid groups (telehealth vs in-person: 0.45 [-1.1 to 2.0]; hybrid vs in-person: 0.48 [-1.0 to 1.9]). Conclusion. Individuals with chronic AT who completed a tendon-loading program with patient education through a telehealth or hybrid format had no worse outcomes for pain than those who received the same intervention through in-person visits. Impact. Physical therapist--directed patient care delivered via telehealth may enhance accessibility to best practice AT rehabilitation, including exercise and education. Use of telehealth technology may also provide an opportunity to prioritize patient preference for physical therapy visit format.},

Our objective is to describe patient experiences with video visits performed with their established primary care clinicians. METHODS We constructed semistructured, in-depth qualitative interviews with adult patients following video visits with their primary care clinicians at a single academic medical center. Data were analyzed with a content analysis approach. RESULTS: Of 32 eligible patients, 19 were successfully interviewed. All patients reported overall satisfaction with video visits, with the majority interested in continuing to use video visits as an alternative to in-person visits. The primary benefits cited were convenience and decreased costs. Some patients felt more comfortable with video visits than office visits and expressed a preference for receiving future serious news via video visit, because they could be in their own supportive environment. Primary concerns with video visits were privacy, including the potential for work colleagues to overhear conversations, and questions about the ability of the clinician to perform an adequate physical examination. CONCLUSIONS Primary care video visits are acceptable in a variety of situations. Patients identified convenience, efficiency, communication, privacy, and comfort as domains that are potentially important to consider when assessing video visits vs in-person encounters. Future studies should explore which patients and conditions are best suited for video visits.},

The following exploratory study examines the user experience of Peloton, an at-home exercise bike that live streams class content, as an opportunity to identify the pathways that initiate and sustain engagement in positive behavior change. A self-report survey of 104 Peloton users is analyzed using Grounded Theory along with a literature review of positive psychology, and performance psychology. Through the analysis, the PERMA well-being framework (Seligman, 2011) and hope (Snyder, 1994) emerge as key theories to facilitate pathways to initiate and sustain users in activity that enhances well-being. A framework and discussion for future directions is proposed emphasizing convenience and pathways of synchronous and asynchronous agency and connection.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of an online musculoskeletal physiotherapy assessment of the knee complex using telerehabilitation compared to traditional face-to-face assessment.MethodsIn a repeated-measures design, 18 subjects who sought treatment for knee pain underwent a traditional face-to-face assessment and a remote telerehabilitation assessment. Telerehabilitation assessments were conducted with participants performing facilitated self-palpation, self-applied modified orthopaedic tests, active movements and functional tasks.ResultsPrimary pathoanatomical diagnoses were in exact agreement in 67\% of cases and were similar in 89\% of cases. The system of pathology was found to be in agreement in 17 out of 18 cases (94\%). Comparisons of objective findings from the two physical assessments demonstrated substantial agreement (kappa\,=\,0.635) for categorical data and binary data (chi-squared\,=\,400.36; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). A high level of intra-rater (89\%) and moderate level of inter-rater (67\%) reliability was evident for telerehabilitation assessments.DiscussionTelerehabilitation assessment of the knee complex appears to be feasible and reliable.

There are numerous types of sensory interaction and this paper examines the interaction of the auditory and visual senses for viewers of multimedia systems. This paper addresses two questions: first, does perception of quality in one modality affect the perception of quality in the other modality and, second, does focusing attention towards one modality affect the viewer's ability to detect errors in the other modality? The perception of audio quality and video quality are closely linked for certain multimedia content. To investigate this relationship, two experiments were conducted where participants were presented with multimedia content where varying distortion had been introduced into both the auditory and visual streams. Participants were asked to state their opinion of the audio, video or overall quality using a standardized scale. Results and subsequent statistical analysis showed that subjective audio quality varied with the video quality and vice versa. Furthermore, when a participant was attending to just one modality, they were less sensitive to reduced quality in the other modality.},

GLA:D Back, a structured group-based patient-education exercise program for LBP, facilitates evidence-based care implementation. This study aimed to inform on the implementation processes, assessing clinician-related factors. Objectives were to describe profiles of implementers and nonimplementers by demographics, and responses to the tailored version of the Determinants of Implementation Behaviour Questionnaire (DIBQ-t) qualitatively explore clinician perspectives on implementation, and compare the results of the DIBQ-t with the interview data to evaluate their fit of integration for facilitators, barriers, and new insights. Methods: A mixed-methods parallel design study was conducted. Physiotherapists and chiropractors, educated in the GLA:D Back program, were asked to complete the DIBQ-t (measuring theoretical determinants of implementation) 6 months after their training. Implementers and nonimplementers of the program were selected for interviews. Qualitative data were used to understand clinicians' viewpoints on implementation, providing a broader perspective on the quantitative data and exploring new aspects. Results: More physiotherapists than chiropractors implemented the program. Implementers responded more positively on most domains of the DIBQ-t. The interviews revealed three themes important for implementation: personal gain, practicalities, and buying-in on the program. Clinicians' attitudes to the program appeared additionally as relevant to implementation. Conclusion: The profession of the clinician was associated with implementation behavior. Implementers and nonimplementers identified the same themes but perceived them as either positive or negative. Both groups reported high levels of knowledge and skills, indicating that training alone is insufficient for implementation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To align with current best practices, manual therapists have refined their treatment options to include exercise and pain education for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. In this commentary, we suggest that manual therapists should also add telehealth to their toolbox. Thus, we aim to discuss the use of telehealth by manual therapists caring for patients with musculoskeletal disorders. MAIN BODY: Telehealth can be delivered to the patient in different modes, such as real-time clinical contact or asynchronously. Platforms vary from websites and smartphone apps to virtual reality systems. Telehealth may be an effective approach, especially for improving pain and function in people with musculoskeletal pain, and it has the potential to reduce the individual and socioeconomic burden of musculoskeletal conditions. However, the certainty of evidence reported in systematic reviews is often low. Factors such as convenience, flexibility, undivided attention from the clinician, user-friendly platforms, goal setting, and use of evidence-based information are all enablers for telehealth use and improving patients' knowledge, self-efficacy, and self-management. Barriers to widening the use of telehealth in musculoskeletal care include the reliability of technology, data privacy issues, difficult to build therapeutic alliance, one-size-fits-all approaches, digital health literacy, and payment models. CONCLUSION: We suggest that practitioners of manual medicine make telehealth part of their clinical toolbox where it makes sense and where there is evidence that it is beneficial for people who seek their care.},

The Power of Nursing (PON) course was identified as meeting this need. With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disruption, faculty gained the opportunity to adapt this discovery model course within the bounds of technology. METHOD: With required modifications, PON was offered as an inaugural online synchronous course using the Zoom platform in its entirety. RESULTS: Participants described feelings of connectedness, an awareness of personal strengths as a health care provider, and a sense of safety and comfort within the virtual platform. Comparing in-person and virtual post-course surveys demonstrated that PON learning experiences can transcend both platforms. CONCLUSION: Currently, with COVID-19 and the need for such transformational experiences, students confirmed that PON can be offered virtually, eliciting the same positive responses to experiential exercises while filling a gap in nursing curricula.

Prior to the pandemic, adoption of telehealth by health care providers was hampered by outdated legislative and regulatory barriers at the federal and state levels. This paper provides a review of the legislative and regulatory landscape for telehealth in the United States and how it has changed during the COVID-10 PHE. It remains to be seen whether the temporary flexibilities surrounding delivery and payment of telehealth services will remain in place; some require Congressional action to make permanent while others can be made permanent through rulemaking. Other actions are dependent on state legislatures and commercial payers. Issues under debate by stakeholders include long-term audio-only coverage; broadband connectivity; disparities in access to telehealth; appropriate payment for telehealth versus in-person care; concerns about fraud, quality, and safety; and the need for additional data to inform future policymaking. Insights are provided into these key issues that are expected to shape future legislative and regulatory action at the federal and state levels. Health care providers and patients need to engage in advocacy work at the federal and state level, and with commercial payers, to affect meaningful long-term change.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this article was to summarize the available evidence from systematic reviews on telerehabilitation in physical therapy.We searched Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. In addition, the records in PROSPERO and Epistemonikos and PEDro were consulted. Systematic reviews of different conditions, populations, and contexts---where the intervention to be evaluated is telerehabilitation by physical therapy---were included. The outcomes were clinical effectiveness depending on specific condition, functionality, quality of life, satisfaction, adherence, and safety. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were carried out by a reviewer with non-independent verification by a second reviewer. The findings are reported qualitatively in the tables and figures.Fifty-three systematic reviews were included, of which 17 were assessed as having low risk of bias. Fifteen reviews were on cardiorespiratory rehabilitation, 14 on musculoskeletal conditions, and 13 on neurorehabilitation. The other 11 reviews addressed other types of conditions and rehabilitation. Thirteen reviews evaluated with low risk of bias showed results in favor of telerehabilitation versus in-person rehabilitation or no rehabilitation, while 17 reported no differences between the groups. Thirty-five reviews with unclear or high risk of bias showed mixed results.Despite the contradictory results, telerehabilitation in physical therapy could be comparable with in-person rehabilitation or better than no rehabilitation for conditions such as osteoarthritis, low-back pain, hip and knee replacement, and multiple sclerosis and also in the context of cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation. It is imperative to conduct better quality clinical trials and systematic reviews.Providing the best available evidence on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation to professionals, mainly physical therapists, will impact the decision-making process and therefore yield better clinical outcomes for patients, both in these times of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future. The identification of research gaps will also contribute to the generation of relevant and novel research questions.},

  abstract = {Despite increased usage of telemedicine to deliver treatment during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the efficacy of telerehabilitation for spine pain is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of telerehabilitation on pain and disability in patients with spine pain treated during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare the results to in-clinic rehabilitation. In this propensity score-matched analysis, 428 patients with spine pain who underwent telerehabilitation during the 6 months of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and 428 patients who underwent in-clinic multimodal rehabilitation treatment during the 6-month period prior to lockdown were compared. Propensity score matching was done based on gender, age, pre-treatment pain, and disability. Post-treatment numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), Oswestry or Neck disability index (ODI or NDI), and minimal clinical important difference (MCID) achieved for NPRS and ODI/NDI scores were compared between the 2 groups. Post-treatment, the mean NPRS (mean difference - 1, p {$<$} 0.0001) and ODI/NDI (mean difference - 5.8, p {$<$} 0.0001) scores, were significantly lower in the telerehabilitation group when compared to control group. Similarly, the percentage of patients who achieved MCID of {$\geq$} 2 for NPRS (mean difference - 6\%, p = 0.0007) and MCID of {$\geq$} 10 for ODI/NDI (mean difference - 7.5\%, p = 0.005) scores were significantly higher in the telerehabilitation group. Telerehabilitation achieved significant reduction in pain and disability among patients with spine pain, better than in-clinic rehabilitation. These encouraging results during the COVID-19 pandemic indicate the need to further explore and test the efficacy and wider application of telerehabilitation for treating spine pain.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTelerehabilitation can help achieve significant reduction in pain and disability among patients with spine pain.These encouraging results indicate the need to further explore a wider application of telerehabilitation for treating patients with spine pain during non-pandemic times.

The recommended first line treatment for non-specific LBP is non-invasive care. A digital care program (DCP) delivering evidence-based non-invasive treatment for LBP can aid self-management by engaging patients and scales personalized therapy for patient-specific needs. We assessed the efficacy of a 12-week DCP for LBP in a two-armed, pre-registered, randomized, controlled trial (RCT). Participants were included based on self-reported duration of LBP, but those with surgery or injury to the lower back in the previous three months were excluded. The treatment group (DCP) received the 12-week DCP, consisting of sensor-guided exercise therapy, education, cognitive behavioral therapy, team and individual behavioral coaching, activity tracking, and symptom tracking -- all administered remotely via an app. The control group received three digital education articles only. All participants maintained access to treatment-as-usual. At 12 weeks, an intention-to-treat analysis showed each primary outcome---Oswestry Disability Index (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), Korff Pain (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and Korff Disability (p\,{$<$}\,0.001)---as well as each secondary outcome improved more for participants in the DCP group compared to control group. For participants who completed the DCP (per protocol), average improvement in pain outcomes ranged 52-64\% (Korff: 48.8--23.4, VAS: 43.6--16.5, VAS impact on daily life: 37.3--13.4; p\,{$<$}\,0.01 for all) and average improvement in disability outcomes ranged 31--55\% (Korff: 33.1--15, ODI: 19.7--13.5; p\,{$<$}\,0.01 for both). Surgical interest significantly reduced in the DCP group. Participants that completed the DCP had an average engagement, each week, of 90\%. Future studies will further explore the effectiveness of the DCP for long-term outcomes beyond 12 weeks and for a LBP patient population with possibly greater baseline pain and disability. In conclusion, the DCP resulted in improved LBP outcomes compared to treatment-as-usual and has potential to scale personalized evidence-based non-invasive treatment for LBP patients.},

Design Mixed methods survey and semistructured interview of persons with CLBP. Setting Prospective observational cohort study of persons with CLBP from 3 health care systems receiving 8 sessions of evidence-based telehealth PT. Participants Participants were selected after completing week 10 (from baseline) assessment from an ongoing cohort study. We enrolled 31 of 126 participants (mean age, 42.4 years; 71.0\% female) from the cohort study (N=31). Interventions Participants had completed 8 sessions of evidence-based telehealth PT and participated in semistructured interviews. Main Outcome Measures Baseline and week 10 and 26 assessments assessed psychosocial risk (StarTBack Screening Tool), working alliance (Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form), pain (Oswestry Disability Index), and health-related quality of life (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 profile, version 2). Semistructured interviews were conducted by telephone and consisted of open-ended questions assessing perception, satisfaction, and likelihood of recommending telehealth PT. Participants identified advantages and disadvantages to telehealth PT. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded using an iterative qualitative process. Statistical comparisons by experience were made using analysis of variance (continuous) and Fisher exact test (categorical). Results Compared with the negative experience group (n=5), participants in positive (n=16) and neutral (n=10) experience groups endorsed higher bond working alliance with their therapist. Participants with a positive experience were more likely to view telehealth PT as cost-saving (n=10, 62.5\%) compared with those with a neutral (n=1, 10.0\%) or negative (n=1, 20.0\%) experience and less likely to view telehealth PT as lower quality (n=0, 0.0\%; n=1, 10.0\%; n=2, 40.0\%, respectively). Prior to starting telehealth, based on semistructured interviews, 18 participants (58.1\%) had concerns and these persisted after starting in half of this group. Concerns regarded telehealth being different from or inferior to in-person PT, lack of physical correction, and worries of not using technology appropriately. Convenience, time savings, and personalization were seen as advantages. Difficulty making a personal connection with the therapist, lack of physical correction, and problems with technology were seen as disadvantages. Many participants endorsed a hybrid approach that included in-person and telehealth PT. Providing necessary equipment and technology assistance was seen as ways to improve telehealth PT experience. Conclusions Telehealth is an acceptable modality to deliver PT for patients with CLBP with most having a positive experience and reporting advantages. Improvements could include offering a hybrid approach (in-person and telehealth combined) and providing necessary equipment and technical support. More research is needed to optimize the most effective strategies for providing telehealth PT for patients with CLBP.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Due to COVID-19 the ability to see all patients face-to-face (FTF) was removed. Services implemented telehealth to cater for patients requiring musculoskeletal care. A service evaluation was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of a mixed telehealth/FTF approach and identify if stratifying patients could help tailor intervention. Methods: Retrospective analysis of data collected from patients who were assessed by Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists in one Scottish health board was undertaken. Patients were divided into low, medium and high risk sub-groups through the Keele STarT MSK tool. Outcome measures for pain and musculoskeletal health were taken at baseline/discharge along with satisfaction/preference. Descriptive and Inferential statistical analysis was conducted to establish whether changes in the outcome measures within and between risk sub-groups were statistically significant. Results: Pain level difference from baseline to discharge demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements across all risk groups (N = 89). Musculoskeletal health demonstrated clinically significant improvements across all risk groups and statistically significant improvements in the medium/high risk groups but not the low risk. Patients with knee osteoarthritis and low back pain in the medium risk group had fewest appointments while patients with chronic shoulder pain had the most. The majority of patients were satisfied with all mediums but preferred FTF or an option between telehealth/FTF in the future. Conclusion: Telehealth is a promising model of care when utilised in combination with FTF for patients with musculoskeletal conditions. Through stratification, identifying specific conditions and shared decision making it may be possible to treat certain patient groups via telehealth.},

  abstract = {Background: Telehealth represents an opportunity for Australia to harness the power of technology to redesign the way health care is delivered. The potential benefits of telehealth include increased accessibility to care, productivity gains for health providers and patients through reduced travel, potential for cost savings, and an opportunity to develop culturally appropriate services that are more sensitive to the needs of special populations. The uptake of telehealth has been hindered at times by clinician reluctance and policies that preclude metropolitan populations from accessing telehealth services. Objective: This study aims to investigate if telehealth reduces health system costs compared with traditional service models and to identify the scenarios in which cost savings can be realized. Methods: A scoping review was undertaken to meet the study aims. Initially, literature searches were conducted using broad terms for telehealth and economics to identify economic evaluation literature in telehealth. The investigators then conducted an expert focus group to identify domains where telehealth could reduce health system costs, followed by targeted literature searches for corresponding evidence. Results: The cost analyses reviewed provided evidence that telehealth reduced costs when health system--funded travel was prevented and when telehealth mitigated the need for expensive procedural or specialist follow-up by providing competent care in a more efficient way. The expert focus group identified 4 areas of potential savings from telehealth: productivity gains, reductions in secondary care, alternate funding models, and telementoring. Telehealth demonstrated great potential for productivity gains arising from health system redesign; however, under the Australian activity-based funding, it is unlikely that these gains will result in cost savings. Secondary care use mitigation is an area of promise for telehealth; however, many studies have not demonstrated overall cost savings due to the cost of administering and monitoring telehealth systems. Alternate funding models from telehealth systems have the potential to save the health system money in situations where the consumers pay out of pocket to receive services. Telementoring has had minimal economic evaluation; however, in the long term it is likely to result in inadvertent cost savings through the upskilling of generalist and allied health clinicians. Conclusions: Health services considering implementing telehealth should be motivated by benefits other than cost reduction. The available evidence has indicated that although telehealth provides overwhelmingly positive patient benefits and increases productivity for many services, current evidence suggests that it does not routinely reduce the cost of care delivery for the health system.},

  abstract = {Objective The Therapeutic Alliance (TA) is an emerging concept within physiotherapy practice, reflecting the ongoing paradigm shift from a biomedical- (BMM) towards a biopsychosocial model (BPSM) of care. Current conceptual understanding of the TA is commonly based on Bordin's (1979) definition, developed within a psychotherapy context. A concept analysis was conducted in order to provide conceptual clarity of the TA within physiotherapy literature. Method An evolutionary method of concept analysis was followed. An extensive literature search was conducted, and eligible articles were submitted to inductive, semantic thematic analysis. Findings A total of 14 articles were included within this concept analysis. 5 master attribute themes, and 4 corresponding sub-themes were identified following thematic analysis. The master attribute themes were: `Seeing the person', `Sharing the journey', `Communication', `Therapeutic space' and `Fostering autonomy'. The 4 Sub-themes were: `Giving of self', `Legitimising the experience', `Physiotherapist characteristics matter' and `Interpersonal collaboration'. Conclusion A heuristic interpretation of the TA within a physiotherapy context is offered. The TA is a dynamic construct within the clinical encounter and is influenced reciprocally between the person seeking care and the physiotherapist by biological, social and psychological contributing factors. `Communication' may act as a catalyst in operationalising the TA in a physiotherapy context. Continued efforts are needed in physiotherapy education and training in both enhancing theoretical awareness of the role of the TA within physiotherapy practice, as well as guidance on its implementation in clinical practice.},

Objective.~           Examine validity and reproducibility of self-report measures of walking capacity for use in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).           Summary of Background Data.~           Treatment outcomes in patients with LSS are often determined using data from self-report questionnaires. Despite some validity evidence available to support the use of self-report instruments in the evaluation of walking capacity in LSS, it is not certain that the construct being tapped using any of the self-report measures is, in fact, walking capacity.           Methods.~           Validity of the Physical Function Scale of the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), self-predicted walking capacity (distance in meters) and a number of single item walking capacity questions was evaluated through comparison with a criterion measure of walking capacity, the Self-Paced Walking Test, in patients with LSS. Test-retest reproducibility was also examined for each of the self-report measures.           Results.~           Subjects included 49 patients (65.8 {\textpm} 10.0 years of age) with LSS confirmed on imaging and by a spine specialist surgeon. The measures found to be most highly associated with the criterion Self-Paced Walking Test were the walking distance item from the ODI (r = 0.83) and self-reported walking capacity in meters (with the aid of a distance reference) (r = 0.80). Reported walking capacity in meters had the lowest test-retest reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.65) of the measures studied.           Conclusion.~           This study provides new information to help guide health professionals and researchers in the selection of appropriate outcome tools when examining walking in an LSS population.

  abstract = {CONTEXT:A novel remote volunteer program was implemented in response to the initial COVID-19 surge in New York City, allowing out-of-state palliative care specialists to serve patients and families in need. No study has detailed the perceptions of these consultants. OBJECTIVES:To understand the experiences of remote volunteer palliative care consultants during the initial COVID-19 surge. METHODS:This qualitative study utilized a thematic analysis approach. During January and February 2021, we conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 15 board-certified palliative care physicians who participated in the program. Codes and emerging themes were identified through iterative discussion and comparison. RESULTS:Five overarching themes (with sub-themes in parentheses) were identified: 1) motivations for participating in the program, 2) logistical evaluation of the program (integration, telehealth model, dyad structure and debriefing sessions), 3) barriers to delivery (language and cultural differences, culture of high-intensity care, legal and administrative differences), 4) emotional burden (moral distress, burnout), and 5) ideas for improvements. Notably, participants observed institutional and cultural differences that posed challenges to delivery of care. Many expressed feelings of distress related to the uncertainty and scarcity caused by the pandemic, although volunteering may have been protective against burnout. CONCLUSION:This study provides an in-depth look at the experiences of remote volunteer palliative care consultants during the initial COVID-19 surge from the unique perspectives of the consultants themselves. Participants expressed overall positive and meaningful experiences and felt that the model was appropriate given the circumstances. Additionally, participants provided recommendations that could guide future implementations of similar programs.},

  abstract = {Background The COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, proliferated worldwide, leading to a pandemic. Many governmental and non-governmental organisations and research institutes are contributing to the COVID-19 fight to control the pandemic. Motivation Numerous telehealth applications have been proposed and adopted during the pandemic to combat the spread of the disease. To this end, powerful tools such as artificial intelligence (AI)/robotic technologies, tracking, monitoring, consultation apps and other telehealth interventions have been extensively used. However, there are several issues and challenges that are currently facing this technology. Objective The purpose of this scoping review is to analyse the primary goal of these techniques; document their contribution to tackling COVID-19; identify and categorise their main challenges and future direction in fighting against the COVID-19 or future pandemic outbreaks. Methods Four digital libraries (ACM, IEEE, Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched to identify relevant sources. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was used as a guideline procedure to develop a comprehensive scoping review. General telehealth features were extracted from the studies reviewed and analysed in the context of the intervention type, technology used, contributions, challenges, issues and limitations. Results A collection of 27 studies were analysed. The reported telehealth interventions were classified into two main categories: AI-based and non-AI-based interventions; their main contributions to tackling COVID-19 are in the aspects of disease detection and diagnosis, pathogenesis and virology, vaccine and drug development, transmission and epidemic predictions, online patient consultation, tracing, and observation; 28 telehealth intervention challenges/issues have been reported and categorised into technical (14), non-technical (10), and privacy, and policy issues (4). The most critical technical challenges are: network issues, system reliability issues, performance, accuracy and compatibility issues. Moreover, the most critical non-technical issues are: the skills required, hardware/software cost, inability to entirely replace physical treatment and people's uncertainty about using the technology. Stringent laws/regulations, ethical issues are some of the policy and privacy issues affecting the development of the telehealth interventions reported in the literature. Conclusion This study provides medical and scientific scholars with a comprehensive overview of telehealth technologies' current and future applications in the fight against COVID-19 to motivate researchers to continue to maximise the benefits of these techniques in the fight against pandemics. Lastly, we recommend that the identified challenges, privacy, and security issues and solutions be considered when designing and developing future telehealth applications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telehealth evaluations of musculoskeletal conditions have increased due to the stay-at-home policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Back pain is one of the most common complaints in primary care. While telehealth may never supplant in-person evaluation of back pain, it is imperative in a changing world to learn to perform this evaluation via telephone or video. Virtual visits rely on history-taking and patient self-reported descriptions of pain elicited from self-palpation or specific movements while on the telephone with the clinician. Video examinations provide a unique way of evaluating the lower back compared to telephone because of the ability to visualize the actions of the patient. OBJECTIVE: To create an evaluation pathway for examination of the lumbar spine via telehealth. METHODS: Our group has created a step-by-step evaluation pathway to help physicians direct their patients through typical lumbar examination elements, including inspection, palpation, range of motion, and strength, special, and functional testing. RESULTS: We have developed a table of questions and instructions and a glossary of images of each maneuver to facilitate lumbar spine examination via telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides a guide for extracting clinically relevant information while performing telemedicine examinations of the lumbar spine.},

Researchers developing theories concerning the introduction of complex change into health care usually take a multifactorial approach; we intentionally sought a single point of intervention that would have maximum impact on implementation. We conducted a qualitative interview study of 36 Australian telehealth services, sampled for maximum variation, and used grounded theory methods to develop a model from which we chose the most important factor affecting the success of telehealth. We propose that clinician acceptance explains much of the variation in the uptake, expansion, and sustainability of Australian telehealth services, and that clinician acceptance could, in most circumstances, overcome low demand, technology problems, workforce pressure, and lack of resourcing. We conclude that our model offers practical advice to those seeking to implement change with limited resources.},

  abstract = {Background Context: Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain presents a global challenge. Individual and group pain management programmes (PMPs) are recommended approaches for patients with chronic MSK disorders. With advances in remote healthcare capability, telehealth, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of telehealth PMPs has become even more evident. Nevertheless, it is not known how~patients perceive PMPs for their MSK complaint when delivered via telehealth.; Objective: To synthesise the evidence of patients' experiences of group and individual telehealth PMPs for chronic MSK pain.; Design: A scoping review informed by the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews.; Data Sources: Based on a planned search strategy, modified following initial searches, an electronic search was conducted of key databases: Cochrane Library, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED, SportDiscus and APA PsychInfo from 2010 until 11 May 2021.; Study Selection: Any qualitative or mixed methods study reporting patient experiences of telehealth PMPs for patients with MSK disorders.; Data Extraction and Data Synthesis: Data were extracted and synthesised using thematic analysis.; Results: From 446 identified studies, 10 were included. Just two studies investigated group telehealth PMPs for patients with MSK disorders, with eight delivered individually. Four main themes emerged: (1) Usability of the technology, (2) Tailored care, (3) Therapeutic alliance and (4) Managing behaviour. The findings highlight patient acceptability of telehealth to support self-management for chronic MSK disorders, with appropriate clinical and technical support. Group telehealth has the potential to empower patients with peer support. Remote delivery of PMPs also impacts on how patients and providers interact, communicate and develop a therapeutic relationship.; Conclusions and Implications: Barriers and enablers to engagement in telehealth PMPs for patients with chronic MSK disorders have been identified. Peer support and group cohesiveness can be achieved remotely to enhance the patient experience. There is a critical need for further research in this area.

  abstract = {Traditionally, rural areas in many countries are limited by a lack of access to health care due to the inherent challenges associated with recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals. Telemedicine, which uses communication technology to deliver medical services over distance, is an economical and potentially effective way to address this problem. In this research, we develop a new telepresence application using an Augmented Reality (AR) system. We explore the use of the Microsoft HoloLens to facilitate and enhance remote medical training. Intrinsic advantages of AR systems enable remote learners to perform complex medical procedures such as Point of Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) without visual interference. This research uses the HoloLens to capture the first-person view of a simulated rural emergency room (ER) through mixed reality capture (MRC) and serves as a novel telemedicine platform with remote pointing capabilities. The mentor's hand gestures are captured using a Leap Motion and virtually displayed in the AR space of the HoloLens. To explore the feasibility of the developed platform, twelve novice medical trainees were guided by a mentor through a simulated ultrasound exploration in a trauma scenario, as part of a pilot user study. The study explores the utility of the system from the trainees, mentor, and objective observers' perspectives and compares the findings to that of a more traditional multi-camera telemedicine solution. The results obtained provide valuable insight and guidance for the development of an AR-supported telemedicine platform.},

  abstract = {As part of new emerging eCommerce innovations, live streaming has started to gain lots of attention in business world because of its potential capability to boost sales online. Enabling interactions among a real-time seller, users (i.e., viewers) and peer users in e-Commerce platforms, live streaming is promising to facilitate real-time interactions among seller, users and peers online, which are likely to alleviate the physical separation between sellers, users and products in cyber space. Although some businesses are proactive to invest on this new living stream platform with a goal to more effectively engage their users, it is still largely unknown whether this effort can ultimately increase their consumer conversion rates. Accordingly, this research aims to gain more in-depth insights into users' acceptance of live streaming shopping. Based on multimedia learning and information foraging theories, this research conceptualizes user engagement mechanisms (i.e., product interactivity, communication immediacy, and peer cues) associated with a live streaming platform and furthermore explores how these mechanisms are likely to improve users' product evaluation and their serendipity to explore more unexpected products, and in turn how they impact users' attitude and intention to buy products on a live streaming platform. Through an online survey study with 200 users on a live streaming platform, this study finds that the identified three user engagement mechanisms significantly improve users' capability to evaluate products and their serendipity behavior online, which also have a positive impact on users' attitude and intention to shop on a live steaming platform.},

Three physical therapy tasks with multiple difficulty levels are selected to help patients with PD improve balance and mobility. Patients' movements are captured by a Kinect sensor. Criteria for each task are carefully designed by our PT co-author such that the patient's performance can be evaluated in an automated manner. Given the patient's motion data, we propose a two-phase human action understanding algorithm TPHAU to understand the patient's movements, and an error identification model to identify the patient's movement errors. To enable automated task recommendation, a machine learning-based model is trained from real patient and PT data to provide accurate, personalized, and timely task update recommendation for patients with PD, thereby emulating a real PT's behavior. Real patient data have been collected in the clinic to train the models. Experiments show that the proposed methods achieve high accuracy in patient action understanding, error identification and task recommendation. The proposed virtual PT system has the potential of enabling ondemand virtual care and significantly reducing cost for both patients and care providers.},

  abstract = {Question Is remotely delivered physiotherapy as good or better than face-to-face physiotherapy for the management of musculoskeletal conditions? Design Randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial with concealed allocation, blinded assessors and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants A total of 210 adult participants with a musculoskeletal condition who presented for outpatient physiotherapy at five public hospitals in Sydney. Intervention One group received a remotely delivered physiotherapy program for 6 weeks that consisted of one face-to-face physiotherapy session in conjunction with weekly text messages, phone calls at 2 and 4 weeks, and an individualised home exercise program delivered through an app. The other group received usual face-to-face physiotherapy care in an outpatient setting. Outcome measures The primary outcome was the Patient Specific Functional Scale at 6 weeks with a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of --15 out of 100 points. Secondary outcomes included: the Patient Specific Functional Scale at 26 weeks; kinesiophobia, pain, function/disability, global impression of change and quality of life at 6 and 26 weeks; and satisfaction with service delivery at 6 weeks. Results The mean between-group difference (95\% CI) for the Patient Specific Functional Scale at 6 weeks was 2.7 out of 100 points (--3.5 to 8.8), where a positive score favoured remotely delivered physiotherapy. The lower end of the 95\% CI was greater than the non-inferiority margin. Whilst non-inferiority margins were not set for the secondary outcomes, the 95\% CI of the mean between-group difference ruled out clinically meaningful differences. Conclusion Remotely delivered physiotherapy with support via phone, text and an app is as good as face-to-face physiotherapy for the management of musculoskeletal conditions.

  abstract = {Background: With the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting many facets of our society, physicians and patients have begun using telemedicine as a platform for the delivery of health care. One of the challenges in implementing telemedicine for the spine care provider is completing a comprehensive spinal examination. Currently, there is no standardized methodology to complete a full spinal examination through telemedicine. Methods: We propose a novel, remote spinal examination methodology that is easily implemented through telemedicine, where the patient is an active participant in the successful completion of his or her examination. This type of examination has been validated in a neurology setting. To facilitate the telemedicine visit, we propose that video instruction be shared with the patient prior to the telemedicine visit to increase the efficacy of the examination. Results: Since the issuance of stay-at-home order across the states, many spine practices around the country have rapidly adopted and increased their telemedicine program to continue provide care for patients during COVID-19 pandemic. At a tertiary academic center in a busy metropolitan area, nearly 700 telemedicine visits were successfully conducted during a 4-week period. There were no remote visits being done prior to the shutdown. Conclusions: Implementation of our proposed remote spinal examination has the potential to serve as a guideline for the spine care provider to efficiently assess patients with spine disease using telemedicine. Because these are only suggestions, providers should tailor examination to each individual patient's needs. Level of Evidence: V. Clinical Relevance: It is likely that physicians will incorporate telemedicine into health care delivery services even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides because of telemedicine's efficiency in meeting patient needs. Using the standard maneuvers provided in our study, spine care providers can perform a nearly comprehensive spine examination through telemedicine. Further studies will be needed to validate the reproducibility and reliability of our methodology.},

  abstract = {Objective: To pilot benchmark measures of health information and communication technology (ICT) availability and use to facilitate cross-country learning.,  Materials and Methods: A prior Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development--led effort involving 30 countries selected and defined functionality-based measures for availability and use of electronic health records, health information exchange, personal health records, and telehealth. In this pilot, an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Working Group compiled results for 38 countries for a subset of measures with broad coverage using new and/or adapted country-specific or multinational surveys and other sources from 2012 to 2015. We also synthesized country learnings to inform future benchmarking.,  Results: While electronic records are widely used to store and manage patient information at the point of care---all but 2 pilot countries reported use by at least half of primary care physicians; many had rates above 75\%---patient information exchange across organizations/settings is less common. Large variations in the availability and use of telehealth and personal health records also exist.,  Discussion: Pilot participation demonstrated interest in cross-national benchmarking. Using the most comparable measures available to date, it showed substantial diversity in health ICT availability and use in all domains. The project also identified methodological considerations (e.g., structural and health systems issues that can affect measurement) important for future comparisons.,  Conclusion: While health policies and priorities differ, many nations aim to increase access, quality, and/or efficiency of care through effective ICT use. By identifying variations and describing key contextual factors, benchmarking offers the potential to facilitate cross-national learning and accelerate the progress of individual countries.},

  abstract = {Background: With the rapid development of mobile health (mHealth) technology, many health apps have been introduced to the commercial market for people with back pain conditions. However, little is known about their content, quality, approaches to care for low back pain (LBP), and associated risks of use. Objective: The aims of this research were to (1) identify apps for the self-management of LBP currently on the market and (2) assess their quality, intervention content, theoretical approaches, and risk-related approaches. Methods: The UK iTunes and Google Play stores were initially searched for apps related to the self-management of LBP in May 2022. A repeat search in June 2023 was conducted to ensure that any relevant new apps developed in the last year were incorporated into the review. A total of 3 keywords recommended by the Cochrane Back and Neck Group were used to search apps ``low back pain,'' ``back pain,'' and ``lumbago.'' The quality of the apps was assessed by using the 5-point Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). Results: A total of 69 apps (25 iOS and 44 Android) met the inclusion criteria. These LBP self-management apps mainly provide recommendations on muscle stretching (n=51, 73.9\%), muscle strengthening (n=42, 60.9\%), core stability exercises (n=32, 46.4\%), yoga (n=19, 27.5\%), and information about LBP mechanisms (n=17, 24.6\%). Most interventions (n=14, 78\%) are consistent with the recommendations in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. The mean (SD) MARS overall score of included apps was 2.4 (0.44) out of a possible 5 points. The functionality dimension was associated with the highest score (3.0), whereas the engagement and information dimension resulted in the lowest score (2.1). Regarding theoretical and risk-related approaches, 18 (26.1\%) of the 69 apps reported the rate of intervention progression, 11 (15.9\%) reported safety checks, only 1 (1.4\%) reported personalization of care, and none reported the theoretical care model or the age group targeted. Conclusions: mHealth apps are potentially promising alternatives to help people manage their LBP; however, most of the LBP self-management apps were of poor quality and did not report the theoretical approaches to care and their associated risks. Although nearly all apps reviewed included a component of care listed in the NICE guidelines, the model of care delivery or embracement of care principles such as the application of a biopsychosocial model was unclear.},

  abstract = {Background Telehealth use is increasing due to its ability to overcome service access barriers and provide continued care when disease transmission is of concern. However, little is known of the validity, reliability and utility of performing physiotherapy assessments using synchronous forms of telehealth across all physiotherapy practice areas. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the current clinometric value of performing physiotherapy assessments using synchronous forms of telehealth across all areas of physiotherapy practice. Methods A comprehensive search of databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Embase and EBSCO) was undertaken to identify studies investigating the clinometric value of performing physiotherapy assessments using synchronous forms of telehealth across all physiotherapy practice areas. Following selection, a quality appraisal was conducted using the Brink and Louw or Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Evidence regarding validity, reliability and utility of synchronous telehealth physiotherapy assessments was extracted and synthesised using a critical narrative approach. Results Thirty-nine studies conducted in a variety of simulated (n\,=\,15) or real-world telehealth environments (n\,=\,24), were included. The quality of the validity, reliability and utility studies varied. Assessments including range of movement, muscle strength, endurance, pain, special orthopaedic tests (shoulder/elbow), Berg Balance Scale, timed up and go, timed stance test, six-minute walk test, steps in 360-degree turn, Movement Assessment Battery for Children (2nd Edition), step test, ABILHAND assessment, active straight leg raise, and circumferential measures of the upper limb were reported as valid/reliable in limited populations and settings (many with small sample sizes). Participants appeared to embrace telehealth technology use, with most studies reporting high levels of participant satisfaction. If given a choice, many reported a preference for in-person physiotherapy assessments. Some inconsistencies in visual/auditory quality and challenges with verbal/non-verbal communication methods were reported. Telehealth was considered relatively cost-effective once services were established. Conclusions Performing physiotherapy assessments using synchronous forms of telehealth appears valid and reliable for specific assessment types in limited populations. Further research is needed in all areas of physiotherapy practice, to strengthen the evidence surrounding its clinometric value. Clinicians contemplating using this assessment mode should consider the client/family preferences, assessment requirements, cultural needs, environment, cost considerations, access and confidence using technology.
